However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 6.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $\\boldsymbol { n }$ , increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 6.2 and Figure 6.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 6.30. ",

Down a group, the $\\mathrm { { I E } } _ { 1 }$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$ . There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as lincreases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium $\\mathrm { ( [ H e ] 2 } s ^ { 2 } )$ is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron $( [ \\mathrm { H e } ] 2 s ^ { 2 } 2 p ^ { 1 } )$ is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton.

Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from an electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms.

Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed.
