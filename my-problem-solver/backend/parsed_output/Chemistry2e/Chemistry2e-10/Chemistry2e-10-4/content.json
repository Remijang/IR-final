Considering the definition of boiling point, plots of vapor pressure versus temperature represent how the boiling point of the liquid varies with pressure. Also described was the use of heating and cooling curves to determine a substance\u2019s melting (or freezing) point. Making such measurements over a wide range of pressures yields data that may be presented graphically as a phase diagram. A phase diagram combines plots of pressure versus temperature for the liquid-gas, solid-liquid, and solid-gas phase-transition equilibria of a substance. These diagrams indicate the physical states that exist under specific conditions of pressure and temperature, and also provide the pressure dependence of the phase-transition temperatures (melting points, sublimation points, boiling points).

        "text": "Since the early 1900s, many methods have been used to decaffeinate coffee. All have advantages and disadvantages, and all depend on the physical and chemical properties of caffeine. Because caffeine is a somewhat polar molecule, it dissolves well in water, a polar liquid. However, since many of the other 400-plus compounds that contribute to coffee\u2019s taste and aroma also dissolve in $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } ,$ , hot water decaffeination processes can also remove some of these compounds, adversely affecting the smell and taste of the decaffeinated coffee. Dichloromethane $\\mathrm { ( C H _ { 2 } C l _ { 2 } ) }$ and ethyl acetate $\\mathrm { C H _ { 3 } C O _ { 2 } C _ { 2 } H _ { 5 } } )$ have similar polarity to caffeine, and are therefore very effective solvents for caffeine extraction, but both also remove some flavor and aroma components, and their use requires long extraction and cleanup times. Because both of these solvents are toxic, health concerns have been raised regarding the effect of residual solvent remaining in the decaffeinated coffee. ",

At temperatures above $3 0 4 . 2 \\mathrm { K }$ and pressures above $7 3 7 6 \\mathrm { k P a }$ , $\\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ is a supercritical fluid, with properties of both gas and liquid. Like a gas, it penetrates deep into the coffee beans; like a liquid, it effectively dissolves certain substances. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of steamed coffee beans removes $9 7 - 9 9 \\%$ of the caffeine, leaving coffee\u2019s flavor and aroma compounds intact. Because $\\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ is a gas under standard conditions, its removal from the extracted coffee beans is easily accomplished, as is the recovery of the caffeine from the extract. The caffeine recovered from coffee beans via this process is a valuable product that can be used subsequently as an additive to other foods or drugs. ",
