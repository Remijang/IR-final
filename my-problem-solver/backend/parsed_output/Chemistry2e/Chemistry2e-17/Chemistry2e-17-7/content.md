Electrochemical cells in which spontaneous redox reactions take place (galvaniccels) have been the topic of discussion so far in this chapter. In these cells, electricalworkisdonebyaredoxsystemonitssur oundingsas electrons produced by the redox reaction are transferred through an external circuit. This final section of the chapter will address an alternative scenario in which anexternalcircuitdoesworkonaredoxsystemby imposing a voltage sufficient to drive an otherwise nonspontaneous reaction, a process known as electrolysis. A familiar example of electrolysis is recharging a battery, which involves use of an external power source to drive the spontaneous (discharge) cell reaction in the reverse direction, restoring to some extent the composition of the half-cells and the voltage of the battery. Perhaps less familiar is the use of electrolysis in the refinement of metallic ores, the manufacture of commodity chemicals, and the electroplatingof metallic coatings on various products (e.g., jewelry, utensils, auto parts). To illustrate the essential concepts of electrolysis, a few specific processes will be considered.

# The Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride

Metallic sodium, Na, and chlorine gas, $\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 }$ , are used in numerous applications, and their industrial production relies on the large-scale electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, ${ \mathrm { N a C l } } ( I )$ . The industrial process typically uses a Downscel similar to the simplified illustration shown in Figure 17.18. The reactions associated with this process are:

$$
\begin{array} { r l r } & { \mathrm { a n o d e : } ~ } & { 2 \mathrm { C l } ^ { - } ( l ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 2 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } } \\ & { \frac { \mathrm { c a t h o d e : } ~ } { \mathrm { c e l l : } ~ } \frac { \mathrm { N a } ^ { + } ( l ) + \mathrm { e } ^ { - } ~ \longrightarrow ~ \mathrm { N a } ( l ) } { 2 \mathrm { N a } ^ { + } ( l ) + 2 \mathrm { C l } ^ { - } ( l ) \longrightarrow ~ 2 \mathrm { N a } ( l ) + \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } ( g ) } } \end{array}
$$

The cell potential for the above process is negative, indicating the reaction as written (decomposition of liquid NaCl) is not spontaneous. To force this reaction, apositivepotentialofmagnitudegreaterthanthenegativecel potentialmust be applied to the cell.

# The Electrolysis of Water

Water may be electrolytically decomposed in a cell similar to the one illustrated in Figure 17.19. To improve electrical conductivity without introducing a different redox species, the hydrogen ion concentration of the water is typically increased by addition of a strong acid. The redox processes associated with this cell are

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { { \mathrm { a n o d e : } \quad } } & { { 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } ( l ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 4 \mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( a q ) + 4 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } \quad } } & { { E _ { \mathrm { a n o d e ~ \Lambda } } ^ { \circ } ~ = ~ + 1 . 2 2 9 \mathrm { ~ V } } } \\ { { \mathrm { } } } & { { \mathrm { c a t h o d e : } 2 \mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( a q ) + 2 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } ~ \longrightarrow ~ \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( g ) } } & { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e ~ \Lambda } } ^ { \circ } ~ = ~ 0 ~ \mathrm { V } } } \\ { { \mathrm { } } } & { { \mathrm { c e l l : } \quad } } & { { 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } ( l ) ~ \longrightarrow ~ 2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( g ) + \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( g ) } } & { { E _ { \mathrm { c e l l ~ \Lambda } } ^ { \circ } ~ = ~ - 1 . 2 2 9 \mathrm { ~ V } } } \end{array}
$$

Again, the cell potential as written is negative, indicating a nonspontaneous cell reaction that must be driven by imposing a cell voltage greater than $+ 1 . 2 2 9 \mathrm { V }$ . Keep in mind that standardelectrode potentials are used to inform thermodynamic predictions here, though the cell is notoperating under standard state conditions. Therefore, at best, calculated cell potentials should be considered ballpark estimates.

# The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride

When aqueous solutions of ionic compounds are electrolyzed, the anode and cathode half-reactions may involve the electrolysis of either water species $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } { \ O } , \mathrm { H } ^ { + } , { \ O }$ H-) or solute species (the cations and anions of the compound). As an example, the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride could involve either of these two anode reactions:

$$
{ \begin{array} { r c l } { { \mathrm { ( i ) ~ 2 C l ^ { - } } ( a q ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 2 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } } } & { { \begin{array} { l } { { E _ { \mathrm { a n o d e } } ^ { \circ } } } \\ { { \mathrm { ( i i ) ~ 2 H _ { 2 } O } ( l ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { O } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 4 \mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( a q ) + 4 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } } } \end{array} } } & { { \begin{array} { l } { { E _ { \mathrm { a n o d e } } ^ { \circ } } } \\ { { \mathrm { ( i n o d e ) } } } \end{array} } } & { { = } } & { { + 1 . 3 5 8 2 7 \mathrm { V } } } \end{array} }
$$

The standard electrode (reduction) potentials of these two half-reactions indicate water may be oxidizedat a less negative/more positive potential (–1.229 V) than chloride ion (–1.358 V). Thermodynamics thus predicts that water would be more readily oxidized, though in practice it is observed that both water and chloride ion are oxidized under typical conditions, producing a mixture of oxygen and chlorine gas.

Turning attention to the cathode, the possibilities for reduction are:

$$
\begin{array} { l l l } { { \mathrm { ( i i i ) ~ 2 H ^ { + } } ( a q ) + 2 { \mathrm { e } } ^ { - } \longrightarrow \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( g ) } } & { { \begin{array} { l } { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e } } ^ { \circ } = 0 \ : \mathrm { V } } } \\ { { \mathrm { ( i v ) ~ 2 H _ { 2 } O ( \it { l } ) + 2 { \mathrm { e } } ^ { - } \longrightarrow \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 2 { \mathrm { O H } } ^ { - } ( a q ) } } } \end{array} } } & { { \begin{array} { l } { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e } } ^ { \circ } = - 0 \ : \mathrm { V } } } \\ { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e } } ^ { \circ } = - 0 . 8 2 7 7 \ : \mathrm { V } } } \end{array} } } \\ { { \mathrm { ( v ) ~ N a ^ { + } } ( a q ) + { \mathrm { e } } ^ { - } \longrightarrow \mathrm { N a } ( s ) } } & { { \begin{array} { l } { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e } } ^ { \circ } = - 2 . 7 1 \ : \mathrm { V } } } \\ { { E _ { \mathrm { c a t h o d e } } ^ { \circ } = { \begin{array} { l } { { - 2 . 7 1 \ : \mathrm { V } } } \end{array} } } } \end{array} } } \end{array}
$$

Comparison of these standardhalf-reaction potentials suggests the reduction of hydrogen ion is

thermodynamically favored. However, in a neutral aqueous sodium chloride solution, the concentration of hydrogen ion is far below the standard state value of 1 $M$ (approximately $1 0 ^ { - 7 } M )$ , and so the observed cathode reaction is actually reduction of water. The net cell reaction in this case is then

$$
2 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } O ( l ) + 2 \mathrm { C l } ^ { - } ( a q ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } ( g ) + \mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } ( g ) + 2 \mathrm { O H } ^ { - } ( a q ) \qquad E _ { \mathrm { c e l l } } ^ { \circ } = - 2 . 1 8 6 \ : \mathrm { V } ^ { \circ } ( a q ) ,
$$

This electrolysis reaction is part of the chlor-alkaliproces used by industry to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide (lye).

# Chemistry in Everyday Life

# Electroplating

An important use for electrolytic cells is in electroplating. Electroplating results in a thin coating of one metal on top of a conducting surface. Reasons for electroplating include making the object more corrosion resistant, strengthening the surface, producing a more attractive finish, or for purifying metal. The metals commonly used in electroplating include cadmium, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, silver, and tin. Common consumer products include silver-plated or gold-plated tableware, chrome-plated automobile parts, and jewelry. The silver plating of eating utensils is used here to illustrate the process. (Figure 17.20).

In the figure, the anode consists of a silver electrode, shown on the left. The cathode is located on the right and is the spoon, which is made from inexpensive metal. Both electrodes are immersed in a solution of silver nitrate. Applying a sufficient potential results in the oxidation of the silver anode

$$
\mathrm { a n o d e : A g } ( s ) \longrightarrow \mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ( a q ) + \mathrm { e } ^ { - }
$$

and reduction of silver ion at the (spoon) cathode:

The net result is the transfer of silver metal from the anode to the cathode. Several experimental factors must be carefully controlled to obtain high-quality silver coatings, including the exact composition of the electrolyte solution, the cell voltage applied, and the rate of the electrolysis reaction (electrical current).

# Quantitative Aspects of Electrolysis

Electrical current is defined as the rate of flow for any charged species. Most relevant to this discussion is the flow of electrons. Current is measured in a composite unit called an ampere, defined as one coulomb per second $\mathrm { ( A } = 1 \mathrm { C } / \mathrm { s } \mathrm { ) }$ ). The charge transferred, $Q ,$ by passage of a constant current, $I ,$ over a specified time interval, $t ,$ is then given by the simple mathematical product

$$
Q = I t
$$

When electrons are transferred during a redox process, the stoichiometry of the reaction may be used to derive the total amount of (electronic) charge involved. For example, the generic reduction process

$$
\mathbf { M } ^ { \mathrm { n + } } ( a q ) + \mathrm { n e } ^ { - } \longrightarrow \mathbf { M } ( s )
$$

involves the transfer of $n$ mole of electrons. The charge transferred is, therefore,

$$
Q = n F
$$

where $F$ is Faraday’s constant, the charge in coulombs for one mole of electrons. If the reaction takes place in an electrochemical cell, the current flow is conveniently measured, and it may be used to assist in stoichiometric calculations related to the cell reaction.

# EXAMPLE 17.9

# Converting Current to Moles of Electrons

In one process used for electroplating silver, a current of 10.23 A was passed through an electrolytic cell for exactly 1 hour. How many moles of electrons passed through the cell? What mass of silver was deposited at the cathode from the silver nitrate solution?

# Solution

Faraday’s constant can be used to convert the charge $( Q )$ into moles of electrons $( n )$ . The charge is the current $( \hat { I } )$ multiplied by the time

$$
n = { \frac { Q } { F } } = { \frac { { \frac { 1 0 . 2 3 \mathrm { ~ C } } { s } } \times 1 { \mathrm { ~ h r ~ } } \times { \frac { 6 0 { \mathrm { ~ m i n } } } { \mathrm { ~ h r } } } \times { \frac { 6 0 \mathrm { ~ s } } { \mathrm { ~ m i n } } } } { 9 6 . 4 8 5 \mathrm { ~ C / m o l ~ e ^ { - } } } } = { \frac { 3 6 . 8 3 0 \mathrm { ~ C } } { 9 6 . 4 8 5 \mathrm { ~ C / m o l ~ e ^ { - } } } } = 0 . 3 8 1 7 { \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ e ^ { - } } }
$$

From the problem, the solution contains $\mathrm { A g N O _ { 3 } }$ , so the reaction at the cathode involves 1 mole of electrons for each mole of silver

The atomic mass of silver is $1 0 7 . 9 \mathrm { g / m o l }$ , so

$$
{ \mathrm { m a s s ~ A g } } = 0 . 3 8 1 7 { \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ e ^ { - } ~ \times ~ } } { \frac { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ m o l ~ A g } } { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ m o l ~ e ^ { - } ~ } } } \times { \frac { 1 0 7 . 9 \ { \mathrm { g ~ A g } } } { \mathrm { ~ 1 ~ m o l ~ A g } } } = 4 1 . 1 9 \ { \mathrm { g ~ A g } }
$$

# Check Your Learning

Aluminum metal can be made from aluminum(III) ions by electrolysis. What is the half-reaction at the cathode? What mass of aluminum metal would be recovered if a current of 25.0 A passed through the solution for 15.0 minutes?

Answer: $\mathrm { A l } ^ { 3 + } ( a q ) + 3 \mathrm { e } ^ { - } \longrightarrow \mathrm { A l } ( s ) ; 0 . 0 7 7 7 \mathrm { m o l } \mathrm { A l } = 2 . 1 0 \mathrm { g } \mathrm { A l } .$

# EXAMPLE 17.10

# Time Required for Deposition

In one application, a $0 . 0 1 0 \mathrm { - m m }$ layer of chromium must be deposited on a part with a total surface area of 3.3 $\mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ from a solution of containing chromium(III) ions. How long would it take to deposit the layer of chromium if the current was 33.46 A? The density of chromium (metal) is $7 . 1 9 \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ .

# Solution

First, compute the volume of chromium that must be produced (equal to the product of surface area and thickness):

$$
{ \mathrm { v o l u m e } } = \left( 0 . 0 1 0 { \mathrm { m m } } \times { \frac { 1 { \mathrm { c m } } } { 1 0 { \mathrm { m m } } } } \right) \times \left( 3 . 3 { \mathrm { m } } ^ { 2 } \times \left( { \frac { 1 0 . 0 0 0 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { 2 } } { 1 { \mathrm { m } } ^ { 2 } } } \right) \right) = 3 3 { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { 3 }
$$

Use the computed volume and the provided density to calculate the molar amount of chromium required:

$$
{ \mathrm { m a s s } } = { \mathrm { v o l u m e } } \times { \mathrm { d e n s i t y } } = 3 3 { \mathrm { ~ c m } } ^ { 3 } \times { \mathrm { ~ } } { \frac { 7 . 1 9 \ { \mathrm { g } } } { { \mathrm { c m } } ^ { 3 } } } = 2 3 7 \ { \mathrm { g } } { \mathrm { C r } }
$$

$$
{ \mathrm { m o l ~ C r } } = 2 3 7 { \mathrm { ~ g ~ C r ~ } } \times { \mathrm { ~ \frac { 1 ~ m o l ~ C r } { 5 2 . 0 0 { \mathrm { ~ g ~ C r } } } ~ } } = 4 . 5 6 { \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ C r } }
$$

The stoichiometry of the chromium(III) reduction process requires three moles of electrons for each mole of chromium(0) produced, and so the total charge required is:

$$
Q = 4 . 5 6 { \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ C r ~ } } \times { \begin{array} { l } { { 3 \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ e ^ { - } ~ } } } \\ { { 1 \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ C r } } } \end{array} } \times { \begin{array} { l } { { 9 6 4 8 5 \mathrm { ~ C } } } \\ { { \mathrm { ~ m o l ~ e ^ { - } ~ } } } \end{array} } = 1 . 3 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { ~ C }
$$

Finally, if this charge is passed at a rate of $3 3 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { C / s }$ , the required time is:

$$
t = { \frac { Q } { I } } = { \frac { 1 . 3 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { C } } { 3 3 . 4 6 \mathrm { C / s } } } = 3 . 9 5 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { s } = 1 1 . 0 \mathrm { h r }
$$

# Summary

# 17.1 Review of Redox Chemistry

Redox reactions are defined by changes in reactant oxidation numbers, and those most relevant to electrochemistry involve actual transfer of electrons. Aqueous phase redox processes often involve water or its characteristic ions, $\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ , as reactants in addition to the oxidant and reductant, and equations representing these reactions can be challenging to balance. The half-reaction method is a systematic approach to balancing such equations that involves separate treatment of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.

# 17.2 Galvanic Cells

Galvanic cells are devices in which a spontaneous redox reaction occurs indirectly, with the oxidant and reductant redox couples contained in separate half-cells. Electrons are transferred from the reductant (in the anode half-cell) to the oxidant (in the cathode half-cell) through an external circuit, and inert solution phase ions are transferred between half-cells, through a salt bridge, to maintain charge neutrality. The construction and composition of a galvanic cell may be succinctly represented using chemical formulas and others symbols in the form of a cell schematic (cell notation).

# 17.3 Electrode and Cell Potentials

The property of potential, $E ,$ , is the energy associated with the separation/transfer of charge. In electrochemistry, the potentials of cells and halfcells are thermodynamic quantities that reflect the driving force or the spontaneity of their redox processes. The cell potential of an electrochemical cell is the difference in between its cathode and anode. To permit easy sharing of half-cell potential data, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is

assigned a potential of exactly $0 \mathrm { v }$ and used to define a single electrode potential for any given half-cell. The electrode potential of a half-cell, $E _ { X } ,$ is the cell potential of said half-cell acting as a cathode when connected to a SHE acting as an anode. When the half-cell is operating under standard state conditions, its potential is the standard electrode potential, $E ^ { \circ } \mathrm { _ X }$ . Standard electrode potentials reflect the relative oxidizing strength of the half-reaction’s reactant, with stronger oxidants exhibiting larger (more positive) $E ^ { o } _ { X }$ values. Tabulations of standard electrode potentials may be used to compute standard cell potentials, $E _ { \ c e l l } ^ { o } | ,$ for many redox reactions. The arithmetic sign of a cell potential indicates the spontaneity of the cell reaction, with positive values for spontaneous reactions and negative values for nonspontaneous reactions (spontaneous in the reverse direction).

# 17.4 Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium

Potential is a thermodynamic quantity reflecting the intrinsic driving force of a redox process, and it is directly related to the free energy change and equilibrium constant for the process. For redox processes taking place in electrochemical cells, the maximum (electrical) work done by the system is easily computed from the cell potential and the reaction stoichiometry and is equal to the free energy change for the process. The equilibrium constant for a redox reaction is logarithmically related to the reaction’s cell potential, with larger (more positive) potentials indicating reactions with greater driving force that equilibrate when the reaction has proceeded far towards completion (large value of $\boldsymbol { K }$ . Finally, the potential of a redox process varies with the composition of the reaction mixture, being related to the reactions standard potential and the value of its reaction quotient, $Q ,$ as described by the Nernst equation.



# 17.5 Batteries and Fuel Cells

Galvanic cells designed specifically to function as electrical power supplies are called batteries. A variety of both single-use batteries (primary cells) and rechargeable batteries (secondary cells) are commercially available to serve a variety of applications, with important specifications including voltage, size, and lifetime. Fuel cells, sometimes called flow batteries, are devices that harness the energy of spontaneous redox reactions normally associated with combustion processes. Like batteries, fuel cells enable the reaction’s electron transfer via an external circuit, but they require continuous input of the redox reactants (fue and oxidant) from an external reservoir. Fuel cells are typically much more efficient in converting the energy released by the reaction to useful work in comparison to internal combustion engines.

# 17.6 Corrosion

Spontaneous oxidation of metals by natural electrochemical processes is called corrosion, familiar examples including the rusting of iron and the tarnishing of silver. Corrosion process involve the creation of a galvanic cell in which different sites on the metal object function as anode and cathode, with the corrosion taking place at the anodic site. Approaches to preventing corrosion of metals include use of a protective coating of zinc (galvanization) and the use of sacrificial anodes connected to the metal object (cathodic protection).



# 17.7 Electrolysis

Nonspontaneous redox processes may be forced to occur in electrochemical cells by the application of an appropriate potential using an external power source—a process known as electrolysis. Electrolysis is the basis for certain ore refining processes, the industrial production of many chemical commodities, and the electroplating of metal coatings on various products. Measurement of the current flow during electrolysis permits stoichiometric calculations.
