Covalent bonds are formed between two atoms when both have similar tendencies to attract electrons to themselves (i.e., when both atoms have identical or fairly similar ionization energies and electron affinities). For example, two hydrogen atoms bond covalently to form an $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ molecule; each hydrogen atom in the $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ molecule has two electrons stabilizing it, giving each atom the same number of valence electrons as the noble gas He.

As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $X$ -axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases.
