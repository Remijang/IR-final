We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol\u2014for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction\u2014replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond\u2014is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a $^ { - 2 }$ oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of $+ 1$ unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of C\u2013O and C\u2013H bonds.
