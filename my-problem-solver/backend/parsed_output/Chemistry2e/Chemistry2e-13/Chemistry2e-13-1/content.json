Reversible reactions, however, may proceed in both forward (left to right) and reverse (right to left) directions. When the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, the concentrations of the reactant and product species remain constant over time and the system is at equilibrium. The relative concentrations of reactants and products in equilibrium systems vary greatly; some systems contain mostly products at equilibrium, some contain mostly reactants, and some contain appreciable amounts of both.

As time passes, $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ is consumed and its concentration falls, while $\\mathrm { N O } _ { 2 }$ is produced and its concentration increases (Figure 13.2b). The decreasing concentration of the reactant slows the forward reaction rate, and the increasing product concentration speeds the reverse reaction rate (Figure 13.2c). This process continues until the forwardandreversereactionratesbecomeequal, at which time the reaction has reached equilibrium, as characterized by constant concentrations of its reactants and products (shaded areas of Figure 13.2b and Figure 13.2c). It\u2019s important to emphasize that chemical equilibria are dynamic; a reaction at equilibrium has not \u201cstopped,\u201d but is proceeding in the forward and reverse directions at the same rate.
