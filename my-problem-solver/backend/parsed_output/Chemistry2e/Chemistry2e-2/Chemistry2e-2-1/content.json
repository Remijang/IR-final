In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for \u201cindivisible.\u201d They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \u201celements\u201d\u2014fire, earth, air, and water\u2014and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \u201celements\u201d as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. ",

A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical properties.   \n3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements.   \n4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio.
