Atoms of many main-group metals lose enough electrons to leave them with the same number of electrons as an atom of the preceding noble gas. To illustrate, an atom of an alkali metal (group 1) loses one electron and forms a cation with a $^ { 1 + }$ charge; an alkaline earth metal (group 2) loses two electrons and forms a cation with a $^ { 2 + }$ charge, and so on. For example, a neutral calcium atom, with 20 protons and 20 electrons, readily loses two electrons. This results in a cation with 20 protons, 18 electrons, and a $^ { 2 + }$ charge. It has the same number of electrons as atoms of the preceding noble gas, argon, and is symbolized $\\mathrm { C a ^ { 2 + } }$ .

Moving from the far left to the right on the periodic table, main-group elements tend to form cations with a charge equal to the group number. That is, group 1 elements form $^ { 1 + }$ ions; group 2 elements form $^ { 2 + }$ ions, and so on. Moving from the far right to the left on the periodic table, elements often form anions with a negative charge equal to the number of groups moved left from the noble gases. For example, group 17 elements (one group left of the noble gases) form 1\u2212 ions; group 16 elements (two groups left) form $2 -$ ions, and so on. This trend can be used as a guide in many cases, but its predictive value decreases when moving toward the center of the periodic table. In fact, transition metals and some other metals often exhibit variable charges that are not predictable by their location in the table.

Instead, ionic compounds must be symbolized by a formula indicating the relative numbersof its constituent ions. For compounds containing only monatomic ions (such as NaCl) and for many compounds containing polyatomic ions (such as $\\mathrm { C a S O } _ { 4 } ,$ , these formulas are just the empirical formulas introduced earlier in this chapter. However, the formulas for some ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions are not empirical formulas. For example, the ionic compound sodium oxalate is comprised of $\\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ and $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ ions combined in a 2:1 ratio, and its formula is written as $\\mathrm { N a _ { 2 } C _ { 2 } O _ { 4 } }$ . The subscripts in this formula are not the smallest-possible whole numbers, as each can be divided by 2 to yield the empirical formula, $\\mathrm { { N a C O } _ { 2 } }$ . This is not the accepted formula for sodium oxalate, however, as it does not accurately represent the compound\u2019s polyatomic anion, $\\mathrm { C } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 } { } ^ { 2 - }$ ",
