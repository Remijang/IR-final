        "text": "The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom\u2019s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom\u2019s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of $1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } \\mathrm { m }$ , whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly $1 0 ^ { - 1 5 }$ m\u2014about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium (Figure 2.11). ",

When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the atomic mass unit (amu) and the fundamental unit of charge (e). The amu was originally defined based on hydrogen, the lightest element, then later in terms of oxygen. Since 1961, it has been defined with regard to the most abundant isotope of carbon, atoms of which are assigned masses of exactly 12 amu. (This isotope is known as \u201ccarbon-12\u201d as will be discussed later in this module.) Thus, one amu is exactly $\\textstyle { \\frac { 1 } { 1 2 } }$ of the mass of one carbon-12 atom: $1 \\mathrm { a m u } = 1 . 6 6 0 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 2 4 } \\mathrm { g }$ . (The Dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative units that are equivalent to the amu.) The fundamental unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron (e) with $\\mathrm { e } = 1 . 6 0 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \\mathrm { C }$ . ",

The electron has a charge of $1 -$ and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton). The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in Table 2.2. (An observant student might notice that the sum of an atom\u2019s subatomic particles does not equal the atom\u2019s actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu.

Oxygen-18 was also critical to the discovery of metabolic pathways and the mechanisms of enzymes.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer (Figure 2.15), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample\u2019s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation\u2019s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent that that of a small steel ball). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a mas spectrum) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications. ",
