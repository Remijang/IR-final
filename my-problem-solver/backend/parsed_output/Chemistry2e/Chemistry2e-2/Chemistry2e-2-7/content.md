# 2.7 Chemical Nomenclature

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Derive names for common types of inorganic compounds using a systematic approach

Nomenclature, a collection of rules for naming things, is important in science and in many other situations. This module describes an approach that is used to name simple ionic and molecular compounds, such as NaCl, $\mathrm { C a C O _ { 3 } }$ , and $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ . The simplest of these are binary compounds, those containing only two elements, but we will also consider how to name ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions, and one specific, very important class of compounds known as acids (subsequent chapters in this text will focus on these compounds in great detail). We will limit our attention here to inorganic compounds, compounds that are composed principally of elements other than carbon, and will follow the nomenclature guidelines proposed by IUPAC. The rules for organic compounds, in which carbon is the principle element, will be treated in a later chapter on organic chemistry.

# Ionic Compounds

To name an inorganic compound, we need to consider the answers to several questions. First, is the compound ionic or molecular? If the compound is ionic, does the metal form ions of only one type (fixed charge) or more than one type (variable charge)? Are the ions monatomic or polyatomic? If the compound is molecular, does it contain hydrogen? If so, does it also contain oxygen? From the answers we derive, we place the compound in an appropriate category and then name it accordingly.

# Compounds Containing Only Monatomic Ions

The name of a binary compound containing monatomic ions consists of the name of the cation (the name of the metal) followed by the name of the anion (the name of the nonmetallic element with its ending replaced by the suffix –ide). Some examples are given in Table $2 . 6$ .

# Names of Some Ionic Compounds

# Compounds Containing Polyatomic Ions

Compounds containing polyatomic ions are named similarly to those containing only monatomic ions, i.e. by naming first the cation and then the anion. Examples are shown in Table 2.7.

# Chemistry in Everyday Life

# Ionic Compounds in Your Cabinets

Every day you encounter and use a large number of ionic compounds. Some of these compounds, where they are found, and what they are used for are listed in Table 2.8. Look at the label or ingredients list on the various products that you use during the next few days, and see if you run into any of those in this table, or find other ionic compounds that you could now name or write as a formula.

# Everyday Ionic Compounds

# Compounds Containing a Metal Ion with a Variable Charge

Most of the transition metals and some main group metals can form two or more cations with different charges. Compounds of these metals with nonmetals are named with the same method as compounds in the first category, except the charge of the metal ion is specified by a Roman numeral in parentheses after the name of the metal. The charge of the metal ion is determined from the formula of the compound and the charge of the anion. For example, consider binary ionic compounds of iron and chlorine. Iron typically exhibits a charge of either $^ { 2 + }$ or $^ { 3 + }$ (see Figure 2.29), and the two corresponding compound formulas are $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 2 }$ and $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ . The simplest name, “iron chloride,” will, in this case, be ambiguous, as it does not distinguish between these two compounds. In cases like this, the charge of the metal ion is included as a Roman numeral in parentheses immediately following the metal name. These two compounds are then unambiguously named iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride, respectively. Other examples are provided in Table 2.9.

Out-of-date nomenclature used the suffixes $- i c$ and –ousto designate metals with higher and lower charges, respectively: Iron(III) chloride, $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ , was previously called ferric chloride, and iron(II) chloride, $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 2 }$ , was known as ferrous chloride. Though this naming convention has been largely abandoned by the scientific community, it remains in use by some segments of industry. For example, you may see the words stan ous fluorideon a tube of toothpaste. This represents the formula $\mathrm { S n F _ { 2 } }$ , which is more properly named tin(II) fluoride. The other fluoride of tin is $\mathrm { S n F } _ { 4 }$ , which was previously called stannic fluoride but is now named tin(IV) fluoride.

# Ionic Hydrates

Ionic compounds that contain water molecules as integral components of their crystals are called hydrates. The name for an ionic hydrate is derived by adding a term to the name for the anhydrous (meaning “not hydrated”) compound that indicates the number of water molecules associated with each formula unit of the compound. The added word begins with a Greek prefix denoting the number of water molecules (see Table 2.10) and ends with “hydrate.” For example, the anhydrous compound copper(II) sulfate also exists as a

hydrate containing five water molecules and named copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. Washing soda is the common name for a hydrate of sodium carbonate containing 10 water molecules; the systematic name is sodium carbonate decahydrate.

Formulas for ionic hydrates are written by appending a vertically centered dot, a coefficient representing the number of water molecules, and the formula for water. The two examples mentioned in the previous paragraph are represented by the formulas

copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate $\mathrm { C u S O } _ { 4 } { \bullet } 5 \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ sodium carbonate decahydrate $\mathrm { N a } _ { 2 } \mathrm { C O } _ { 3 } { \bullet } \mathrm { 1 0 H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$

# EXAMPLE 2.13

# Naming Ionic Compounds

Name the following ionic compounds

(a) $\mathrm { F e _ { 2 } S _ { 3 } }$   
(b) CuSe   
(c) GaN   
(d) $\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } { \cdot } 7 H _ { 2 } O }$   
(e) $\mathrm { T i } _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } ) _ { 3 }$

# Solution

The anions in these compounds have a fixed negative charge $( \mathsf { S } ^ { 2 - }$ , $\mathsf { S e } ^ { 2 - }$ , $\mathsf { N } ^ { 3 - }$ , and ${ \mathrm { S O } _ { 4 } } ^ { 2 - }$ and the compounds must be neutral. Because the total number of positive charges in each compound must equal the total number of negative charges, the positive ions must be $\mathrm { F e ^ { 3 + } }$ , $\mathsf { C u ^ { 2 + } }$ , $\mathsf { G a } ^ { 3 + }$ , $\mathrm { M g ^ { 2 + } }$ , and $\mathrm { T i ^ { 3 + } }$ . These charges are used in the names of the metal ions:

(a) iron(III) sulfide   
(b) copper(II) selenide   
(c) gallium(III) nitride   
(d) magnesium sulfate heptahydrate   
(e) titanium(III) sulfate

# Chemistry in Everyday Life

# Erin Brockovich and Chromium Contamination

In the early 1990s, legal file clerk Erin Brockovich (Figure 2.32) discovered a high rate of serious illnesses in the small town of Hinckley, California. Her investigation eventually linked the illnesses to groundwater contaminated by $\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ used by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) to fight corrosion in a nearby natural gas pipeline. As dramatized in the film ErinBrockovich(for which Julia Roberts won an Oscar), Erin and lawyer Edward Masry sued PG&E for contaminating the water near Hinckley in 1993. The settlement they won in 1996— $\$ 333$ million—was the largest amount ever awarded for a direct-action lawsuit in the US at that time.

Chromium compounds are widely used in industry, such as for chrome plating, in dye-making, as preservatives, and to prevent corrosion in cooling tower water, as occurred near Hinckley. In the environment, chromium exists primarily in either the Cr(III) or $\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ forms. $\mathrm { C r } ( \mathrm { I I I } )$ , an ingredient of many vitamin and nutritional supplements, forms compounds that are not very soluble in water, and it has low toxicity. But $\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ is much more toxic and forms compounds that are reasonably soluble in water. Exposure to small amounts of $\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ can lead to damage of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, as well as the kidneys, liver, blood, and skin.

Despite cleanup efforts, $\mathrm { C r } ( \mathsf { V I } )$ groundwater contamination remains a problem in Hinckley and other locations across the globe. A 2010 study by the Environmental Working Group found that of 35 US cities tested, 31 had higher levels of $\mathrm { C r ( V I ) }$ in their tap water than the public health goal of 0.02 parts per billion set by the California Environmental Protection Agency.

# Molecular (Covalent) Compounds

The bonding characteristics of inorganic molecular compounds are different from ionic compounds, and they are named using a different system as well. The charges of cations and anions dictate their ratios in ionic compounds, so specifying the names of the ions provides sufficient information to determine chemical formulas. However, because covalent bonding allows for significant variation in the combination ratios of the atoms in a molecule, the names for molecular compounds must explicitly identify these ratios.

# Compounds Composed of Two Elements

When two nonmetallic elements form a molecular compound, several combination ratios are often possible. For example, carbon and oxygen can form the compounds CO and $\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ . Since these are different substances with different properties, they cannot both have the same name (they cannot both be called carbon oxide). To deal with this situation, we use a naming method that is somewhat similar to that used for ionic compounds, but with added prefixes to specify the numbers of atoms of each element. The name of the more metallic element (the one farther to the left and/or bottom of the periodic table) is first, followed by the name of the more nonmetallic element (the one farther to the right and/or top) with its ending changed to the suffix –ide. The numbers of atoms of each element are designated by the Greek prefixes shown in Table 2.10.

When only one atom of the first element is present, the prefix mono- is usually deleted from that part. Thus, CO is named carbon monoxide, and $\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ is called carbon dioxide. When two vowels are adjacent, the ain the Greek prefix is usually dropped. Some other examples are shown in Table 2.11.

There are a few common names that you will encounter as you continue your study of chemistry. For example, although NO is often called nitric oxide, its proper name is nitrogen monoxide. Similarly, $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ is known as nitrous oxide even though our rules would specify the name dinitrogen monoxide. (And $\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ is usually called water, not dihydrogen monoxide.) You should commit to memory the common names of compounds as you encounter them.

# EXAMPLE 2.14

# Naming Covalent Compounds

Name the following covalent compounds:

(a) ${ \mathrm { S F } } _ { 6 }$ (b) $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 3 }$ (c) $\mathrm { C l } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 7 }$

(d) $\mathrm { P } _ { 4 } \mathrm { O } _ { 6 }$

# Solution

Because these compounds consist solely of nonmetals, we use prefixes to designate the number of atoms of each element:

(a) sulfur hexafluoride (b) dinitrogen trioxide (c) dichlorine heptoxide (d) tetraphosphorus hexoxide

# Check Your Learning

(a) phosphorus pentachloride (b) dinitrogen monoxide (c) iodine heptafluoride (d) carbon tetrachloride

Answer: (a) $\mathrm { P C l } _ { 5 }$ ; (b) $\mathrm { N _ { 2 } O }$ ; (c) $\mathrm { I F } _ { 7 }$ ; (d) $\mathrm { C C l } _ { 4 }$

# LINK TO LEARNING

The following website (http://openstax.org/l/16chemcompname) provides practice with naming chemical compounds and writing chemical formulas. You can choose binary, polyatomic, and variable charge ionic compounds, as well as molecular compounds.

# Binary Acids

Some compounds containing hydrogen are members of an important class of substances known as acids. The chemistry of these compounds is explored in more detail in later chapters of this text, but for now, it will suffice to note that many acids release hydrogen ions, $\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ , when dissolved in water. To denote this distinct chemical property, a mixture of water with an acid is given a name derived from the compound’s name. If the compound is a binary acid (comprised of hydrogen and one other nonmetallic element):

1. The word “hydrogen” is changed to the prefix hydro  
2. The other nonmetallic element name is modified by adding the suffix -ic   
3. The word “acid” is added as a second word

For example, when the gas HCl (hydrogen chloride) is dissolved in water, the solution is called hydrochloric acid. Several other examples of this nomenclature are shown in Table 2.12.

# Names of Some Simple Acids

# Oxyacids

Many compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly discuss the important compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:

1. Omit “hydrogen”   
2. Start with the root name of the anion   
3. Replace –atewith –ic, or –itewith –ous   
4. Add “acid”

For example, consider $\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ (which you might be tempted to call “hydrogen carbonate”). To name this correctly, “hydrogen” is omitted; the –ateof carbonate is replace with –ic; and acid is added—so its name is carbonic acid. Other examples are given in Table 2.13. There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., $\mathrm { H _ { 2 } S O _ { 4 } }$ is called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and $\mathrm { H _ { 2 } S O _ { 3 } }$ is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).

# Summary

# 2.1 Early Ideas in Atomic Theory

The ancient Greeks proposed that matter consists of extremely small particles called atoms. Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, wholenumber ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental proportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio. During any chemical change, atoms are neither created nor destroyed.

# 2.2 Evolution of Atomic Theory

Although no one has actually seen the inside of an atom, experiments have demonstrated much about atomic structure. Thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small,

dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons. Chadwick discovered that the nucleus also contains neutral particles called neutrons. Soddy demonstrated that atoms of the same element can differ in mass; these are called isotopes.

# 2.3 Atomic Structure and Symbolism

An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly $\textstyle { \frac { 1 } { 1 2 } }$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to $1 . 6 6 0 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 4 } \mathrm { g }$ .

Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of $^ { 1 + }$ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of $1 -$ and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the

numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.

Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.

# 2.4 Chemical Formulas

A molecular formula uses chemical symbols and subscripts to indicate the exact numbers of different atoms in a molecule or compound. An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms.

# 2.5 The Periodic Table

The discovery of the periodic recurrence of similar properties among the elements led to the formulation of the periodic table, in which the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number in rows known as periods and columns known as groups. Elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties. Elements can be classified as metals, metalloids, and nonmetals, or as a main-group elements, transition metals, and inner transition metals. Groups are numbered 1–18 from left to right. The elements in group 1 are known as the alkali metals; those in group 2 are the alkaline earth metals; those in 15 are the pnictogens; those in 16 are the chalcogens; those in 17 are the halogens; and those in 18 are the noble gases.

# 2.6 Ionic and Molecular Compounds

Metals (particularly those in groups 1 and 2) tend to lose the number of electrons that would leave them with the same number of electrons as in the preceding noble gas in the periodic table. By this means, a positively charged ion is formed. Similarly, nonmetals (especially those in groups 16 and 17, and, to a lesser extent, those in Group 15) can gain the number of electrons needed to provide atoms with the same number of electrons as in the next noble gas in the periodic table. Thus, nonmetals tend to form negative ions. Positively charged ions are called cations, and negatively charged ions are called anions. Ions can be either monatomic (containing only one atom) or polyatomic (containing more than one atom).



Compounds that contain ions are called ionic compounds. Ionic compounds generally form from metals and nonmetals. Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms that behave as a single unit), are called covalent compounds. Covalent compounds usually form from two nonmetals.

# 2.7 Chemical Nomenclature

Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to –ide. For example, $\mathrm { K _ { 2 } O }$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 2 }$ is iron(II) chloride and $\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include ${ \mathrm { S F } } _ { 6 }$ , sulfur hexafluoride, and $\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ , dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the –idesuffix to –ic, and adding “acid;” HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (–ateto –icand –iteto –ous), and adding “acid;” $\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ is carbonic acid.

8. Predict and test the behavior of $\alpha$ particles fired at a “plum pudding” model atom. (a) Predict the paths taken by $\alpha$ particles that are fired at atoms with a Thomson’s plum pudding model structure. Explain why you expect the $\alpha$ particles to take these paths. (b) If $\alpha$ particles of higher energy than those in (a) are fired at plum pudding atoms, predict how their paths will differ from the lower-energy $\alpha$ particle paths. Explain your reasoning. (c) Now test your predictions from (a) and (b). Open the Rutherford Scattering simulation (http://openstax.org/l/16PhetScatter) and select the “Plum Pudding Atom” tab. Set “Alpha Particles Energy” to “min,” and select “show traces.” Click on the gun to start firing $\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (a)? If not, explain why the actual path would be that shown in the simulation. Hit the pause button, or “Reset All.” Set “Alpha Particles Energy” to “max,” and start firing $\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (b)? If not, explain the effect of increased energy on the actual paths as shown in the simulation.

9. Predict and test the behavior of $\alpha$ particles fired at a Rutherford atom model.

(a) Predict the paths taken by $\alpha$ particles that are fired at atoms with a Rutherford atom model structure. Explain why you expect the $\alpha$ particles to take these paths.   
(b) If $\alpha$ particles of higher energy than those in (a) are fired at Rutherford atoms, predict how their paths will differ from the lower-energy $\alpha$ particle paths. Explain your reasoning.   
(c) Predict how the paths taken by the $\alpha$ particles will differ if they are fired at Rutherford atoms of elements other than gold. What factor do you expect to cause this difference in paths, and why?   
(d) Now test your predictions from (a), (b), and (c). Open the Rutherford Scattering simulation   
(http://openstax.org/l/16PhetScatter) and select the “Rutherford Atom” tab. Due to the scale of the simulation, it is best to start with a small nucleus, so select “20” for both protons and neutrons, “min” for energy, show traces, and then start firing $\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (a)? If not, explain why the actual path would be that shown in the simulation. Pause or reset, set energy to “max,” and start firing $\alpha$ particles. Does this match your prediction from (b)? If not, explain the effect of increased energy on the actual path as shown in the simulation. Pause or reset, select “40” for both protons and neutrons, “min” for energy, show traces, and fire away. Does this match your prediction from (c)? If not, explain why the actual path would be that shown in the simulation. Repeat this with larger numbers of protons and neutrons. What generalization can you make regarding the type of atom and effect on the path of $\alpha$ particles? Be clear and specific.

21. Repeat Exercise 2.20 using an element that has three naturally occurring isotopes.

22. An element has the following natural abundances and isotopic masses: $9 0 . 9 2 \%$ abundance with 19.99 amu, $0 . 2 6 \%$ abundance with 20.99 amu, and $8 . 8 2 \%$ abundance with 21.99 amu. Calculate the average atomic mass of this element.

23. Average atomic masses listed by IUPAC are based on a study of experimental results. Bromine has two isotopes, $^ { 7 9 } \mathrm { { B r } }$ and $^ { 8 1 } \mathrm { { B r } , }$ whose masses (78.9183 and 80.9163 amu, respectively) and abundances $5 0 . 6 9 \%$ and $4 9 . 3 1 \%$ , respectively) were determined in earlier experiments. Calculate the average atomic mass of bromine based on these experiments.

24. Variations in average atomic mass may be observed for elements obtained from different sources. Lithium provides an example of this. The isotopic composition of lithium from naturally occurring minerals is $7 . 5 \% ^ { 6 } \mathrm { L i }$ and $9 2 . 5 \% 7 \mathrm { L i }$ , which have masses of 6.01512 amu and 7.01600 amu, respectively. A commercial source of lithium, recycled from a military source, was $3 . 7 5 \% ^ { 6 } \mathrm { L i }$ (and the rest $^ { 7 } \mathrm { L i }$ ). Calculate the average atomic mass values for each of these two sources.

25. The average atomic masses of some elements may vary, depending upon the sources of their ores. Naturally occurring boron consists of two isotopes with accurately known masses $( ^ { 1 0 } \mathrm { B } , 1 0 . 0 1 2 9 \$ amu and $\mathrm { ^ { 1 1 } B }$ , 11.00931 amu). The actual atomic mass of boron can vary from 10.807 to 10.819, depending on whether the mineral source is from Turkey or the United States. Calculate the percent abundances leading to the two values of the average atomic masses of boron from these two countries.   
26. The $^ { 1 8 } 0 ! ^ { 1 6 } 0$ abundance ratio in some meteorites is greater than that used to calculate the average atomic mass of oxygen on earth. Is the average mass of an oxygen atom in these meteorites greater than, less than, or equal to that of a terrestrial oxygen atom?
