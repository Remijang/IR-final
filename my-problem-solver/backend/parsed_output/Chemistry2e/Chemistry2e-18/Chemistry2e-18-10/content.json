Superheated water ( $\\mathrm { 1 7 0 ^ { \\circ } C }$ and 10 atm pressure) is forced down the outermost of three concentric pipes to the underground deposit. The hot water melts the sulfur. The innermost pipe conducts compressed air into the liquid sulfur. The air forces the liquid sulfur, mixed with air, to flow up through the outlet pipe. Transferring the mixture to large settling vats allows the solid sulfur to separate upon cooling. This sulfur is $9 9 . 5 \\%$ to $9 9 . 9 \\%$ pure and requires no purification for most uses. ",

It oxidizes metals, giving a variety of binary sulfides in which sulfur exhibits a negative oxidation state (2\u2212). Elemental sulfur oxidizes less electronegative nonmetals, and more electronegative nonmetals, such as oxygen and the halogens, will oxidize it. Other strong oxidizing agents also oxidize sulfur. For example, concentrated nitric acid oxidizes sulfur to the sulfate ion, with the concurrent formation of nitrogen(IV) oxide: ",
