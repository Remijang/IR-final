A warm lizard can move faster than a cold one because the chemical reactions that allow its muscles to move occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. A cold lizard is a slower lizard and an easier meal for predators. ",

        "text": "From baking a cake to determining the useful lifespan of a bridge, rates of chemical reactions play important roles in our understanding of processes that involve chemical changes. Two questions are typically posed when planning to carry out a chemical reaction. The first is: \u201cWill the reaction produce the desired products in useful quantities?\u201d The second question is: \u201cHow rapidly will the reaction occur?\u201d A third question is often asked when investigating reactions in greater detail: \u201cWhat specific molecular-level processes take place as the reaction occurs?\u201d Knowing the answer to this question is of practical importance when the yield or rate of a reaction needs to be controlled.
