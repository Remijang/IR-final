An internal force acts between elements of the system. Again looking at Figure 4.5(a), the force the child in the wagon exerts to hang onto the wagon is an internal force between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system, according to Newton\u2019s first law.

Sometimes the system is obvious, whereas other times identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle.
