# 16.11 Energy in Waves: Intensity

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Calculate the intensity and the power of rays and waves.

All waves carry energy. The energy of some waves can be directly observed. Earthquakes can shake whole cities to the ground, performing the work of thousands of wrecking balls.

Loud sounds pulverize nerve cells in the inner ear, causing permanent hearing loss. Ultrasound is used for deep-heat treatment of muscle strains. A laser beam can burn away a malignancy. Water waves chew up beaches.

The amount of energy in a wave is related to its amplitude. Large-amplitude earthquakes produce large ground displacements. Loud sounds have higher pressure amplitudes and come from larger-amplitude source vibrations than soft sounds. Large ocean breakers churn up the shore more than small ones. More quantitatively, a wave is a displacement that is resisted by a restoring force. The larger the displacement $x$ , the larger the force $F = k x$ needed to create it. Because work $W$ is related to force multiplied by distance $( F x )$ and energy is put into the wave by the work done to create it, the energy in a wave is related to amplitude. In fact, a wave’s energy is directly proportional to its amplitude squared because

$$
W \propto F x = k x ^ { 2 } .
$$

The energy effects of a wave depend on time as well as amplitude. For example, the longer deep-heat ultrasound is applied, the more energy it transfers. Waves can also be concentrated or spread out. Sunlight, for example, can be

focused to burn wood. Earthquakes spread out, so they do less damage the farther they get from the source. In both cases, changing the area the waves cover has important effects. All these pertinent factors are included in the definition of intensity $I$ as power per unit area:

$$
I = { \frac { P } { A } } 
$$

where $P$ is the power carried by the wave through area $A$ . The definition of intensity is valid for any energy in transit, including that carried by waves. The SI unit for intensity is watts per square meter $( { \mathrm { W / m } } ^ { 2 } )$ ). For example, infrared and visible energy from the Sun impinge on Earth at an intensity of $1 3 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ just above the atmosphere. There are other intensity-related units in use, too. The most common is the decibel. For example, a 90 decibel sound level corresponds to an intensity of $1 0 ^ { - 3 } \ \mathrm { W / m } ^ { 2 }$ . (This quantity is not much power per unit area considering that 90 decibels is a relatively high sound level. Decibels will be discussed in some detail in a later chapter.

# EXAMPLE 16.9

# Calculating intensity and power: How much energy is in a ray of sunlight?

The average intensity of sunlight on Earth’s surface is about $7 0 0 \mathrm { w } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ .

(a) Calculate the amount of energy that falls on a solar collector having an area of $0 . 5 0 0 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ in $4 . 0 0 \mathrm { h }$ . (b) What intensity would such sunlight have if concentrated by a magnifying glass onto an area 200 times smaller than its own?

# Strategy a

Because power is energy per unit time or $\textstyle P = { \frac { E } { t } } $ , the definition of intensity can be written as $\begin{array} { r } { I = \frac { P } { A } = \frac { E / t } { A } } \end{array}$ , and this equation can be solved for E with the given information.

# Solution a

1. Begin with the equation that states the definition of intensity:

$$
I = { \frac { P } { A } } .
$$

2. Replace $P$ with its equivalent $E / t$ :

$$
I = { \frac { E / t } { A } } .
$$

3. Solve for $E$ :

$$
E = I A t .
$$

4. Substitute known values into the equation:

$$
E = \dot { \left( 7 0 0 ~ \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \right) } \left( 0 . 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \right) [ ( 4 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { h } ) ( 3 6 0 0 ~ \mathrm { s } / \mathrm { h } ) ] .
$$

5. Calculate to find $E$ and convert units:

$$
{ 5 . 0 4 \times 1 0 ^ { 6 } \mathrm { \ J } } ,
$$

# Discussion a

The energy falling on the solar collector in $4 h$ in part is enough to be useful—for example, for heating a significant amount of water.

# Strategy b

Taking a ratio of new intensity to old intensity and using primes for the new quantities, we will find that it depends on the ratio of the areas. All other quantities will cancel.

# Solution b

1. Take the ratio of intensities, which yields:

$$
{ \frac { I ^ { \prime } } { I } } = { \frac { P ^ { \prime } / A ^ { \prime } } { P / A } } = { \frac { A } { A ^ { \prime } } } \ \biggl ( \mathrm { T h e ~ p o w e r s ~ c a n c e l ~ b e c a u s e ~ } P ^ { \prime } = P \biggr ) .
$$

2. Identify the knowns:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { A = 2 0 0 A ^ { \prime } , } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { { \displaystyle \frac { I ^ { \prime } } { I } = 2 0 0 . } } } \end{array}
$$

3. Substitute known quantities:

$$
I ^ { \prime } = 2 0 0 I = 2 0 0 \big ( 7 0 0 { \mathrm { W / m } } ^ { 2 } \big ) .
$$

4. Calculate to find $I ^ { \prime }$ :

$$
\begin{array} { r } { I ^ { \prime } = 1 . 4 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ \mathrm { W / m } ^ { 2 } . } \end{array}
$$

# Discussion b

Decreasing the area increases the intensity considerably. The intensity of the concentrated sunlight could even start a fire.

# EXAMPLE 16.10

# Determine the combined intensity of two waves: Perfect constructive interference

If two identical waves are spatially separated, each having an intensity of $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { { w / m ^ { 2 } } }$ , interfere perfectly constructively in a particular location, what is the intensity of the wave at this particular location?

# Strategy

We know from Superposition and Interference that when two identical waves, which have equal amplitudes $X$ , interfere perfectly constructively, the resulting wave has an amplitude of $2 X$ . Because a wave’s intensity is proportional to amplitude squared, the intensity of the resulting wave is four times as great as in the individual waves.

# Solution

1. Recall that intensity is proportional to amplitude squared.

2. Calculate the new amplitude:

$$
I ^ { \mathbf { \Omega ^ { \prime } } } \propto \left( \boldsymbol { X } ^ { \mathbf { \Omega ^ { \prime } } } \right) ^ { 2 } = \left( 2 \boldsymbol { X } \right) ^ { 2 } = 4 \boldsymbol { X } ^ { 2 } .
$$

3. Recall that the intensity of the old amplitude was:

$$
I \propto X ^ { 2 } .
$$

4. Take the ratio of new intensity to the old intensity. This gives:

$$
\frac { I ^ { ^ { \prime } } } { I } = 4 .
$$

5. Calculate to find $\boldsymbol { I } ^ { \prime }$ :

$$
I ^ { \prime } = 4 I = 4 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } .
$$

# Discussion

The intensity goes up by a factor of 4 when the amplitude doubles. This answer is a little disquieting. The two individual waves each have intensities of $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ , yet their sum has an intensity of $4 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ , which may appear to violate conservation of energy. This violation, of course, cannot happen. What does happen is intriguing. The area over which the intensity is $4 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ is much less than the area covered by the two waves before they interfered. There are other areas where the intensity is zero. The addition of waves is not as simple as our first look in Superposition and Interference suggested. We actually get a pattern of both constructive interference and

destructive interference whenever two waves are added. For example, if we have two stereo speakers putting out $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ each, there will be places in the room where the intensity is $4 . 0 0 \mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ , other places where the intensity is zero, and others in between. Figure 16.41 shows what this interference might look like. We will pursue interference patterns elsewhere in this text.

# Section Summary

# 16.1 Hooke’s Law: Stress and Strain Revisited

• An oscillation is a back and forth motion of an object between two points of deformation.   
• An oscillation may create a wave, which is a disturbance that propagates from where it was created. The simplest type of oscillations and waves are related to systems that can be described by

Hooke’s law: $F = - k x .$ ， where $F$ is the restoring force, $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium or deformation, and $k$ is the force constant of the system. • Elastic potential energy $\mathrm { P E _ { \mathrm { e l } } }$ stored in the deformation of a system that can be described by Hooke’s law is given by $\mathrm { P E _ { e l } } = ( 1 / 2 ) k x ^ { 2 }$

# 16.2 Period and Frequency in Oscillations

• Periodic motion is a repetitious oscillation.   
The time for one oscillation is the period $T$ .   
• The number of oscillations per unit time is the frequency $f$ .   
These quantities are related by $f = { \frac { 1 } { T } } .$

# 16.3 Simple Harmonic Motion: A Special Periodic Motion

• Simple harmonic motion is oscillatory motion for a system that can be described only by Hooke’s law. Such a system is also called a simple harmonic oscillator.   
• Maximum displacement is the amplitude $X$ . The period $T$ and frequency $f$ of a simple harmonic oscillator are given by $T = 2 \pi { \sqrt { \frac { m } { k } } }$ and $\begin{array} { r } { f = \frac { 1 } { 2 \pi } \sqrt { \frac { k } { m } } } \end{array}$ , where $m$ is the mass of the system.   
• Displacement in simple harmonic motion as a function of time is given by $x ( t ) = X$ cos $\textstyle { \frac { 2 \pi t } { T } }$   
The velocity is given by $\begin{array} { r } { v ( t ) = - v _ { \mathrm { m a x } } \mathrm { s i n } { \frac { 2 \pi t } { T } } } \end{array}$ where $v _ { \mathrm { m a x } } = \sqrt { k / m } X$ .   
• The acceleration is found to be $\begin{array} { r } { a ( t ) = - \frac { k X } { m } } \end{array}$ cos $\textstyle { \frac { 2 \pi t } { T } }$

# 16.4 The Simple Pendulum

• A mass suspended by a wire of length $L$ is a simple pendulum and undergoes simple harmonic motion for amplitudes less than about $1 5 ^ { \circ }$ . The period of a simple pendulum is $T = 2 \pi { \sqrt { \frac { L } { g } } } ,$ where $L$ is the length of the string and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

# 16.5 Energy and the Simple Harmonic Oscillator

Energy in the simple harmonic oscillator is shared between elastic potential energy and kinetic   
energy, with the total being constant:   
${ \frac { 1 } { 2 } } m v ^ { 2 } + { \frac { 1 } { 2 } } k x ^ { 2 } =$ constant.   
Maximum velocity depends on three factors: it is directly proportional to amplitude, it is greater for stiffer systems, and it is smaller for objects that have larger masses:   
$v _ { \mathrm { m a x } } = \sqrt { \frac { k } { m } } X .$

# 16.6 Uniform Circular Motion and Simple Harmonic Motion

A projection of uniform circular motion undergoes simple harmonic oscillation.

# 16.7 Damped Harmonic Motion

• Damped harmonic oscillators have nonconservative forces that dissipate their energy.   
• Critical damping returns the system to equilibrium as fast as possible without overshooting.   
• An underdamped system will oscillate through the equilibrium position.   
• An overdamped system moves more slowly toward equilibrium than one that is critically damped.

# 16.8 Forced Oscillations and Resonance

• A system’s natural frequency is the frequency at which the system will oscillate if not affected by driving or damping forces.   
• A periodic force driving a harmonic oscillator at its natural frequency produces resonance. The system is said to resonate.   
• The less damping a system has, the higher the amplitude of the forced oscillations near resonance. The more damping a system has, the broader response it has to varying driving frequencies.

# 16.9 Waves

• A wave is a disturbance that moves from the point of creation with a wave velocity $v _ { \mathrm { w } }$ . • A wave has a wavelength $\lambda$ , which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. • Wave velocity and wavelength are related to the wave’s frequency and period by $\begin{array} { r } { v _ { \mathrm { w } } = \frac { \lambda } { T } } \end{array}$ or $v _ { \mathrm { { w } } } = f \lambda$ A transverse wave has a disturbance perpendicular to its direction of propagation, whereas a longitudinal wave has a disturbance parallel to its direction of propagation.

# 16.10 Superposition and Interference

• Superposition is the combination of two waves at the same location.   
• Constructive interference occurs when two identical waves are superimposed in phase. Destructive interference occurs when two identical waves are superimposed exactly out of phase.   
• A standing wave is one in which two waves superimpose to produce a wave that varies in amplitude but does not propagate. Nodes are points of no motion in standing waves.   
• An antinode is the location of maximum amplitude of a standing wave.   
• Waves on a string are resonant standing waves with a fundamental frequency and can occur at higher multiples of the fundamental, called overtones or harmonics.   
• Beats occur when waves of similar frequencies $f _ { 1 }$ and $f _ { 2 }$ are superimposed. The resulting amplitude



oscillates with a beat frequency given by $f _ { \mathrm { B } } = | f _ { 1 } - f _ { 2 } |$

# 16.11 Energy in Waves: Intensity

Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area: $\textstyle I = { \frac { P } { A } } $ and has units of $\mathrm { W } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ .
