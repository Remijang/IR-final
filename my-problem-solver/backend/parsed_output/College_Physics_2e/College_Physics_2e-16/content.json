        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO OSCILLATORY MOTION AND WAVES What do an ocean buoy, a child in a swing, the cone inside a speaker, a guitar, atoms in a crystal, the motion of chest cavities, and the beating of hearts all have in common? They all oscillate\u2014-that is, they move back and forth between two points. Many systems oscillate, and they have certain characteristics in common. All oscillations involve force and energy. You push a child in a swing to get the motion started. The energy of atoms vibrating in a crystal can be increased with heat. You put energy into a guitar string when you pluck it. ",

You can no doubt think of other types of waves. Some, such as water waves, are visible. Some, such as sound waves, are not. But everywaveisadisturbancethatmovesfromitssourceandcaries energy. Other examples of waves include earthquakes and visible light. Even subatomic particles, such as electrons, can behave like waves. ",

We begin by studying the type of force that underlies the simplest oscillations and waves. We will then expand our exploration of oscillatory motion and waves to include concepts such as simple harmonic motion, uniform circular motion, and damped harmonic motion. Finally, we will explore what happens when two or more waves share the same space, in the phenomena known as superposition and interference. ",
