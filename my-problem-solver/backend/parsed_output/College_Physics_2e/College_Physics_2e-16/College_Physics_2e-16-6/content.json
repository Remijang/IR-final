        "text": "There is an easy way to produce simple harmonic motion by using uniform circular motion. Figure 16.16 shows one way of using this method. A ball is attached to a uniformly rotating vertical turntable, and its shadow is projected on the floor as shown. The shadow undergoes simple harmonic motion. Hooke\u2019s law usually describes uniform circular motions ( $\\omega$ constant) rather than systems that have large visible displacements. So observing the projection of uniform circular motion, as in Figure 16.16, is often easier than observing a precise large-scale simple harmonic oscillator. If studied in sufficient depth, simple harmonic motion produced in this manner can give considerable insight into many aspects of oscillations and waves and is very useful mathematically. In our brief treatment, we shall indicate some of the major features of this relationship and how they might be useful. ",
