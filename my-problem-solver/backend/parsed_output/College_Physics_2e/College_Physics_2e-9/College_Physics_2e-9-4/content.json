In Figure 9.18, the pole\u2019s cg lies halfway between the vaulter\u2019s hands. It seems reasonable that the force exerted by each hand is equal to half the weight of the pole, or $2 4 . 5 \\mathsf { N }$ . This obviously satisfies the first condition for equilibrium $\\mathbf { F } = 0 \\mathrm { \\ : \\ : }$ . The second condition $\\pmb { \\tau } = 0$ is also satisfied, as we can see by choosing the cg to be the pivot point. The weight exerts no torque about a pivot point located at the cg, since it is applied at that point and its lever arm is zero. The equal forces exerted by the hands are equidistant from the chosen pivot, and so they exert equal and opposite torques. Similar arguments hold for other systems where supporting forces are exerted symmetrically about the cg. For example, the four legs of a uniform table each support one-fourth of its weight. ",

In fact, if the right hand is moved directly under the cg, it will support all the weight. This situation is exactly analogous to two people carrying a load; the one closer to the cg carries more of its weight.
