This force typically depends on the object\u2019s speed (in contrast with simple friction). Experiments have shown that for laminar flow ( $N _ { \\mathrm { R } } ^ { \\prime }$ less than about one) viscous drag is proportional to speed, whereas for $N _ { \\mathrm { R } } ^ { \\prime }$ between about 10 and $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ , viscous drag is proportional to speed squared. (This relationship is a strong dependence and is pertinent to bicycle racing, where even a small headwind causes significantly increased drag on the racer. Cyclists take turns being the leader in the pack for this reason.) For $N _ { \\mathrm { R } } ^ { \\prime }$ greater than $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ , drag increases dramatically and behaves with greater complexity. For laminar flow around a sphere, $F _ { \\mathrm { V } }$ is proportional to fluid viscosity $\\eta ,$ , the object\u2019s characteristic size $L$ , and its speed $v$ . All of which makes sense\u2014the more viscous the fluid and the larger the object, the more drag we expect. Recall Stoke\u2019s law $F _ { \\mathrm { S } } = 6 \\pi r \\eta v$ . For the special case of a small sphere of radius $R$ moving slowly in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta ,$ , the drag force $F _ { \\mathrm { S } }$ is given by ",

        "text": "An interesting consequence of the increase in $F _ { \\mathrm { V } }$ with speed is that an object falling through a fluid will not continue to accelerate indefinitely (as it would if we neglect air resistance, for example). Instead, viscous drag increases, slowing acceleration, until a critical speed, called the terminal speed, is reached and the acceleration of the object becomes zero. Once this happens, the object continues to fall at constant speed (the terminal speed). This is the case for particles of sand falling in the ocean, cells falling in a centrifuge, and sky divers falling through the air. Figure 12.19 shows some of the factors that affect terminal speed. There is a viscous drag on the object that depends on the viscosity of the fluid and the size of the object. But there is also a buoyant force that depends on the density of the object relative to the fluid. Terminal speed will be greatest for low-viscosity fluids and objects with high densities and small sizes. Thus a skydiver falls more slowly with outspread limbs than when they are in a pike position\u2014head first with hands at their side and legs together. ",
