34.7 Some Questions We Know to Ask

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Identify sample questions to be asked on the largest scales.   
• Identify sample questions to be asked on the intermediate scale.   
• Identify sample questions to be asked on the smallest scales.

Throughout the text we have noted how essential it is to be curious and to ask questions in order to first understand what is known, and then to go a little farther. Some questions may go unanswered for centuries; others may not have answers, but some bear delicious fruit. Part of discovery is knowing which questions to ask. You have to know something before you can even phrase a decent question. As you may have noticed, the mere act of asking a question can give you the answer. The following questions are a sample of those physicists now know to ask and are representative of the forefronts of physics. Although these questions are important, they will be replaced by others

if answers are found to them. The fun continues.

On the Largest Scale

1. Istheuniverseopenorclosed? Theorists would like it to be just barely closed and evidence is building toward that conclusion. Recent measurements in the expansion rate of the universe and in CMBR support a flat universe. There is a connection to small-scale physics in the type and number of particles that may contribute to closing the universe.   
2. Whatisdarkmater? It is definitely there, but we really do not know what it is. Conventional possibilities are being ruled out, but one of them still may explain it. The answer could reveal whole new realms of physics and the disturbing possibility that most of what is out there is unknown to us, a completely different form of matter.   
3. Howdogalaxiesform? They exist since very early in the evolution of the universe and it remains difficult to understand how they evolved so quickly. The recent finer measurements of fluctuations in the CMBR may yet allow us to explain galaxy formation.   
4. Whatisthenatureofvarious-mas blackholes? Only recently have we become confident that many black hole candidates cannot be explained by other, less exotic possibilities. But we still do not know much about how they form, what their role in the history of galactic evolution has been, and the nature of space in their vicinity. However, so many black holes are now known that correlations between black hole mass and galactic nuclei characteristics are being studied.   
5. Whatisthemechanismfortheenergyoutputofquasars? These distant and extraordinarily energetic objects now seem to be early stages of galactic evolution with a supermassive black-hole-devouring material. Connections are now being made with galaxies having energetic cores, and there is evidence consistent with less consuming, supermassive black holes at the center of older galaxies. New instruments are allowing us to see deeper into our own galaxy for evidence of our own massive black hole.   
6. Wheredothe burstscomefrom? We see bursts of rays coming from all directions in space, indicating the sources are very distant objects rather than something associated with our own galaxy. Some bursts finally are being correlated with known sources so that the possibility they may originate in binary neutron star interactions or black holes eating a companion neutron star can be explored.

On the Intermediate Scale

1. Howdophasetransitionstakeplaceonthemicroscopicscale? We know a lot about phase transitions, such as water freezing, but the details of how they occur molecule by molecule are not well understood. Similar questions about specific heat a century ago led to early quantum mechanics. It is also an example of a complex adaptive system that may yield insights into other self-organizing systems.   
2. Isthereawaytodealwithnonlinearphenomenathatrevealsunderlyingcon ections? Nonlinear phenomena lack a direct or linear proportionality that makes analysis and understanding a little easier. There are implications for nonlinear optics and broader topics such as chaos.   
3. Howdohigh-  superconductorsbecomeresistanceles atsuchhightemperatures? Understanding how they work may help make them more practical or may result in surprises as unexpected as the discovery of superconductivity itself.   
4. Therearemagneticefectsinmaterialswedonotunderstand—howdotheywork? Although beyond the scope of this text, there is a great deal to learn in condensed matter physics (the physics of solids and liquids). We may find surprises analogous to lasing, the quantum Hall effect, and the quantization of magnetic flux. Complexity may play a role here, too.

On the Smallest Scale

1. Arequarksandleptonsfundamental,ordotheyhaveasubstructure? The higher energy accelerators that are just completed or being constructed may supply some answers, but there will also be input from cosmology and other systematics.   
2. Whydoleptonshaveintegralchargewhilequarkshavefractionalcharge? If both are fundamental and analogous as thought, this question deserves an answer. It is obviously related to the previous question.   
3. Whyaretherethre familiesofquarksandleptons? First, does this imply some relationship? Second, why three and only three families?   
4. Areal forcestrulyequal(unified)undercertaincircumstances? They don’t have to be equal just because we want them to be. The answer may have to be indirectly obtained because of the extreme energy at which we think they are unified.   
5. Arethereotherfundamentalforces? There was a flurry of activity with claims of a fifth and even a sixth force a few years ago. Interest has subsided, since those forces have not been detected consistently. Moreover, the proposed forces have strengths similar to gravity, making them extraordinarily difficult to detect in the presence of stronger forces. But the question remains; and if there are no other forces, we need to ask why only four and why these four.   
6. Istheprotonstable? We have discussed this in some detail, but the question is related to fundamental aspects of the unification of forces. We may never know from experiment that the proton is stable, only that it is very long lived.   
7. Aretheremagneticmonopoles? Many particle theories call for very massive individual north- and south-pole particles—magnetic monopoles. If they exist, why are they so different in mass and elusiveness from electric charges, and if they do not exist, why not?   
8. Doneutrinoshavemas ? Definitive evidence has emerged for neutrinos having mass. The implications are significant, as discussed in this chapter. There are effects on the closure of the universe and on the patterns in particle physics.   
9. Whatarethesystematiccharacteristicsofhigh-  nuclei? All elements with  or less (with the exception of 115 and 117) have now been discovered. It has long been conjectured that there may be an island of relative stability near  , and the study of the most recently discovered nuclei will contribute to our understanding of nuclear forces.

These lists of questions are not meant to be complete or consistently important—you can no doubt add to it yourself. There are also important questions in topics not broached in this text, such as certain particle symmetries, that are of current interest to physicists. Hopefully, the point is clear that no matter how much we learn, there always seems to be more to know. Although we are fortunate to have the hard-won wisdom of those who preceded us, we can look forward to new enlightenment, undoubtedly sprinkled with surprise.

Section Summary

34.1 Cosmology and Particle Physics

• Cosmology is the study of the character and evolution of the universe. • The two most important features of the universe are the cosmological red shifts of its galaxies being proportional to distance and its cosmic microwave background (CMBR). Both support the notion that there was a gigantic explosion, known as the Big Bang that created the universe.

• Galaxies farther away than our local group have, on an average, a recessional velocity given by  ， where  is the distance to the galaxy and  is the Hubble constant, taken to have the average value    
• Explanations of the large-scale characteristics of the universe are intimately tied to particle physics.   
• The dominance of matter over antimatter and the smoothness of the CMBR are two characteristics that are tied to particle physics.   
• The epochs of the universe are known back to very shortly after the Big Bang, based on known laws of physics.   
• The earliest epochs are tied to the unification of forces, with the electroweak epoch being partially understood, the GUT epoch being speculative, and the TOE epoch being highly speculative since it involves an unknown single superforce.   
• The transition from GUT to electroweak is called spontaneous symmetry breaking. It released energy that caused the inflationary scenario, which in turn explains the smoothness of the CMBR.

34.2 General Relativity and Quantum Gravity

• Einstein’s theory of general relativity includes accelerated frames and, thus, encompasses special relativity and gravity. Created by use of careful thought experiments, it has been repeatedly verified by real experiments.   
• One direct result of this behavior of nature is the gravitational lensing of light by massive objects, such as galaxies, also seen in the microlensing of light by smaller bodies in our galaxy.   
• Another prediction is the existence of black holes, objects for which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light and from which nothing can escape.   
• The event horizon is the distance from the object at which the escape velocity equals the speed of light . It is called the Schwarzschild radius  and is given by  where  is the universal gravitational constant, and  is the mass of the body.   
Physics is unknown inside the event horizon, and the possibility of wormholes and time travel are being studied.   
• Candidates for black holes may power the extremely energetic emissions of quasars, distant objects that seem to be early stages of galactic evolution.   
• Neutron stars are stellar remnants, having the density of a nucleus, that hint that black holes could form from supernovas, too.   
• Gravitational waves are wrinkles in space, predicted by general relativity but not yet observed, caused by changes in very massive objects.   
• Quantum gravity is an incompletely developed theory that strives to include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and unification of forces (thus, a TOE).   
• One unconfirmed connection between general relativity and quantum mechanics is the predictio of characteristic radiation from just outside black holes.

34.3 Superstrings

• Superstring theory holds that fundamental particles are one-dimensional vibrations analogous to those on strings and is an attempt at a theory of quantum gravity.

34.4 Dark Matter and Closure

• Dark matter is non-luminous matter detected in and around galaxies and galactic clusters.   
• It may be 10 times the mass of the luminous matter in the universe, and its amount may determine whether the universe is open or closed (expands forever or eventually stops).   
• The determining factor is the critical density of the universe and the cosmological constant, a theoretical construct intimately related to the expansion and closure of the universe. The critical density  is the density needed to just halt universal expansion. It is estimated to be approximately  .   
• An open universe is negatively curved, a closed universe is positively curved, whereas a universe with exactly the critical density is flat.   
• Dark matter’s composition is a major mystery, but it may be due to the suspected mass of neutrinos or a completely unknown type of leptonic matter.   
• If neutrinos have mass, they will change families, a process known as neutrino oscillations, for which there is growing evidence.

34.5 Complexity and Chaos

• Complexity is an emerging field, rooted primarily in physics, that considers complex adaptive systems and their evolution, including self-organization.   
• Complexity has applications in physics and many

other disciplines, such as biological evolution.

• Chaos is a field that studies systems whose properties depend extremely sensitively on some variables and whose evolution is impossible to predict.   
• Chaotic systems may be simple or complex.   
• Studies of chaos have led to methods for understanding and predicting certain chaotic behaviors.

34.6 High-temperature Superconductors

• High-temperature superconductors are materials that become superconducting at temperatures well above a few kelvin.   
• The critical temperature  is the temperature below which a material is superconducting.

• Some high-temperature superconductors have verified  s above  , and there are reports of  s as high as  .

34.7 Some Questions We Know to Ask

• On the largest scale, the questions which can be asked may be about dark matter, dark energy, black holes, quasars, and other aspects of the universe.   
• On the intermediate scale, we can query about gravity, phase transitions, nonlinear phenomena, high-  superconductors, and magnetic effects on materials.   
• On the smallest scale, questions may be about quarks and leptons, fundamental forces, stability of protons, and existence of monopoles.

Conceptual Questions

34.1 Cosmology and Particle Physics

1. Explain why it only ap earsthat we are at the center of expansion of the universe and why an observer in another galaxy would see the same relative motion of all but the closest galaxies away from her.   
2. If there is no observable edge to the universe, can we determine where its center of expansion is? Explain.   
3. If the universe is infinite, does it have a center? Discuss.   
4. Another known cause of red shift in light is the source being in a high gravitational field. Discuss how this can be eliminated as the source of galactic red shifts, given that the shifts are proportional to distance and not to the size of the galaxy.   
5. If some unknown cause of red shift—such as light becoming “tired” from traveling long distances through empty space—is discovered, what effect would there be on cosmology?   
6. Olbers’s paradox poses an interesting question: If the universe is infinite, then any line of sight should eventually fall on a star’s surface. Why then is the sky dark at night? Discuss the commonly accepted evolution of the universe as a solution to this paradox.   
7. If the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is the remnant of the Big Bang’s fireball, we expect to see hot and cold regions in it. What are two causes of these wrinkles in the CMBR? Are the observed temperature variations greater or less than originally expected?   
8. The decay of one type of  -meson is cited as evidence that nature favors matter over antimatter. Since mesons are composed of a quark and an antiquark, is it surprising that they would preferentially decay to one type over another? Is this an asymmetry in nature? Is the predominance of matter over antimatter an asymmetry?   
9. Distances to local galaxies are determined by measuring the brightness of stars, called Cepheid variables, that can be observed individually and that have absolute brightnesses at a standard distance that are well known. Explain how the measured brightness would vary with distance as compared with the absolute brightness.   
10. Distances to very remote galaxies are estimated based on their apparent type, which indicate the number of stars in the galaxy, and their measured brightness. Explain how the measured brightness would vary with distance. Would there be any correction necessary to compensate for the red shift of the galaxy (all distant galaxies have significant red shifts)? Discuss possible causes of uncertainties in these measurements.   
11. If the smallest meaningful time interval is greater than zero, will the lines in Figure 34.9 ever meet?

34.2 General Relativity and Quantum Gravity

12. Quantum gravity, if developed, would be an improvement on both general relativity and quantum mechanics, but more mathematically difficult. Under what circumstances would it be necessary to use quantum gravity? Similarly, under what circumstances could general relativity be used? When could special relativity, quantum mechanics, or classical physics be used?   
13. Does observed gravitational lensing correspond to a converging or diverging lens? Explain briefly.   
14. Suppose you measure the red shifts of all the images produced by gravitational lensing, such as in Figure 34.12.You find that the central image has a red shift less than the outer images, and those all have the same red shift. Discuss how this not only shows that the images are of the same object, but also implies that the red shift is not affected by taking different paths through space. Does it imply that cosmological red shifts are not caused by traveling through space (light getting tired, perhaps)?   
15. What are gravitational waves, and have they yet been observed either directly or indirectly?   
16. Is the event horizon of a black hole the actual physical surface of the object?   
17. Suppose black holes radiate their mass away and the lifetime of a black hole created by a supernova is about  years. How does this lifetime compare with the accepted age of the universe? Is it surprising that we do not observe the predicted characteristic radiation?

34.4 Dark Matter and Closure

18. Discuss the possibility that star velocities at the edges of galaxies being greater than expected is due to unknown properties of gravity rather than to the existence of dark matter. Would this mean, for example, that gravity is greater or smaller than expected at large distances? Are there other tests that could be made of gravity at large distances, such as observing the motions of neighboring galaxies?   
19. How does relativistic time dilation prohibit neutrino oscillations if they are massless?   
20. If neutrino oscillations do occur, will they violate conservation of the various lepton family numbers  , and  )? Will neutrino oscillations violate conservation of the total number of leptons?   
21. Lacking direct evidence of WIMPs as dark matter, why must we eliminate all other possible explanations based on the known forms of matter before we invoke their existence?

34.5 Complexity and Chaos

22. Must a complex system be adaptive to be of interest in the field of complexity? Give an example to support your answer.   
23. State a necessary condition for a system to be chaotic.

34.6 High-temperature Superconductors

24. What is critical temperature  ? Do all materials have a critical temperature? Explain why or why not.   
25. Explain how good thermal contact with liquid nitrogen can keep objects at a temperature of 77 K (liquid nitrogen’s boiling point at atmospheric pressure).   
26. Not only is liquid nitrogen a cheaper coolant than liquid helium, its boiling point is higher (77 K vs.  . How does higher temperature help lower the cost of cooling a material? Explain in terms of the rate of heat transfer being related to the temperature difference between the sample and its surroundings.

34.7 Some Questions We Know to Ask

27. For experimental evidence, particularly of previously unobserved phenomena, to be taken seriously it must be reproducible or of sufficiently high quality that a single observation is meaningful. Supernova 1987A is not reproducible. How do we know observations of it were valid? The fifth force is not broadly accepted. Is this due to lack of reproducibility or poor-quality experiments (or both)? Discuss why forefront experiments are more subject to observational problems than those involving established phenomena.   
28. Discuss whether you think there are limits to what humans can understand about the laws of physics. Support your arguments.

Show that the velocity of a star orbiting its galaxy in a circular orbit is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the mass of the stars inside its orbit acts like a single mass at the center of the galaxy.

(d) Compare the radius found in part (c) with the 4-ly average separation of stars in the arms of the Milky Way.

34.6 High-temperature Superconductors

31. A section of superconducting wire carries a current of 100 A and requires 1.00 L of liquid nitrogen per hour to keep it below its critical temperature. For it to be economically advantageous to use a superconducting wire, the cost of cooling the wire must be less than the cost of energy lost to heat in the wire. Assume that the cost of liquid nitrogen is  0.30\ per kW·h. What is the resistance of a normal wire that costs as much in wasted electric energy as the cost of liquid nitrogen for the superconductor?

32. Critical Thinking Assume two galaxies are  apart. (a) How fast are they separating due to space expansion? (b) Now suppose a third galaxy is located  Mly along a line that is a perpendicular bisector of the line segment between the first two galaxies. How fast is this galaxy separating from either of the other two galaxies? (c) Why would the third galaxy appear to be receding from both of the initially mentioned galaxies at the same rate? (d) How would the apparent motion be detected?
