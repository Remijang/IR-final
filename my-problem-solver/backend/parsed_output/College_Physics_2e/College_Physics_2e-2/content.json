        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO ONE-DIMENSIONAL KINEMATICS Objects are in motion everywhere we look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. And even in inanimate objects, there is continuous motion in the vibrations of atoms and molecules. Questions about motion are interesting in and of themselves: Howlongwil ittakeforaspace probetogettoMars?Wherewil afo tbal landifitisthrownatacertainangle?But an understanding of motion is also key to understanding other concepts in physics. An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the study of force. ",

The word \u201ckinematics\u201d comes from a Greek term meaning motion and is related to other English words such as \u201ccinema\u201d (movies) and \u201ckinesiology\u201d (the study of human motion). In one-dimensional kinematics and TwoDimensional Kinematics we will study only the motionof a football, for example, without worrying about what forces cause or change its motion. Such considerations come in other chapters. In this chapter, we examine the simplest ",
