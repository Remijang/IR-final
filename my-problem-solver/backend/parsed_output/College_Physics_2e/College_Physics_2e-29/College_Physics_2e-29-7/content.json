You might imagine that the electrons are interfering with one another as any waves do. To test this, you can lower the intensity until there is never more than one electron between the slits and the screen. The same interference pattern builds up! This implies that a particle\u2019s probability distribution spans both slits, and the particles actually interfere with themselves. Does this also mean that the electron goes through both slits? An electron is a basic unit of matter that is not divisible. But it is a fair question, and so we should look to see if the electron traverses one slit or the other, or both. One possibility is to have coils around the slits that detect charges moving through them. What is observed is that an electron always goes through one slit or the other; it does not split to go through both. But there is a catch. If you determine that the electron went through one of the slits, you no longer get a double slit pattern\u2014instead, you get single slit interference. There is no escape by using another method of determining which slit the electron went through. Knowing the particle went through one slit forces a single-slit pattern. If you do not observe which slit the electron goes through, you obtain a double-slit pattern. ",

Neither uncertainty can become small without the other becoming large. A small wavelength allows accurate position measurement, but it increases the momentum of the probe to the point that it further disturbs the momentum of a system being measured. For example, if an electron is scattered from an atom and has a wavelength small enough to detect the position of electrons in the atom, its momentum can knock the electrons from their orbits in a manner that loses information about their original motion. It is therefore impossible to follow an electron in its orbit around an atom. If you measure the electron\u2019s position, you will find it in a definite location, but the atom will be disrupted. Repeated measurements on identical atoms will produce interesting probability distributions for electrons around the atom, but they will not produce motion information. The probability distributions are referred to as electron clouds or orbitals. The shapes of these orbitals are often shown in general chemistry texts and are discussed in The Wave Nature of Matter Causes Quantization. ",

An uncertainty in energy of only a few millionths of an eV results. This uncertainty is small compared with typical excitation energies in atoms, which are on the order of 1 eV.

        "text": "The uncertainty principle for energy and time can be of great significance if the lifetime of a system is very short. Then $\\Delta t$ is very small, and $\\Delta E$ is consequently very large. Some nuclei and exotic particles have extremely short lifetimes (as small as $1 0 ^ { - 2 5 } ~ \\mathrm { s } ,$ ), causing uncertainties in energy as great as many GeV $( 1 0 ^ { 9 } { \\mathrm { ~ e V } } )$ . Stored energy appears as increased rest mass, and so this means that there is significant uncertainty in the rest mass of shortlived particles. When measured repeatedly, a spread of masses or decay energies are obtained. The spread is $\\Delta E$ . You might ask whether this uncertainty in energy could be avoided by not measuring the lifetime. The answer is no. Nature knows the lifetime, and so its brevity affects the energy of the particle. This is so well established experimentally that the uncertainty in decay energy is used to calculate the lifetime of short-lived states. Some nuclei and particles are so short-lived that it is difficult to measure their lifetime. But if their decay energy can be measured, its spread is $\\Delta E$ , and this is used in the uncertainty principle $\\Delta E \\Delta t \\geq h / 4 \\pi )$ to calculate the lifetime $\\Delta t$ ",

If energy is uncertain by $\\Delta E$ , then conservation of energy can be violated by $\\Delta E$ for a time $\\Delta t$ . Neither the physicist nor nature can tell that conservation of energy has been violated, if the violation is temporary and smaller than the uncertainty in energy. While this sounds innocuous enough, we shall see in later chapters that it allows the temporary creation of matter from nothing and has implications for how nature transmits forces over very small distances.

A definite position is determined each time we observe an electron, for example. But repeated measurements produce a spread in values consistent with wave characteristics.

However, what there are as they travel we cannot tell because, when we do try to measure, we affect the traveling. ",
