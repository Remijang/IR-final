In the X-ray region, there is the Chandra X-ray Observatory (launched in 1999), and in the -ray region, there is the new Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (launched in 2008\u2014taking the place of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, 1991\u20132000). The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in late 2021, observes in a lower-frequency portion of the spectrum compared to Hubble. The JWST observes in long-wavelength visible light (red) through infrared, enabling it to detect objects that are further away, older, and fainter than previous telescopes could detect. ",
