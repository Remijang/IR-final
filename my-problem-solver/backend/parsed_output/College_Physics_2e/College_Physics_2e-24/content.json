Sound creates pressure variations (waves) in matter, such as air or water, or your eardrum. Conversely, radio waves are electromagneticwaves, like visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. EM waves don\u2019t need a medium in which to propagate; they can travel through a vacuum, such as outer space. ",

The prediction was made by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century when he formulated a single theory combining all the electric and magnetic effects known by scientists at that time. \u201cElectromagnetic waves\u201d was the name he gave to the phenomena his theory predicted.

The underlying connections and unity of physics allow certain great minds to solve puzzles without having all the pieces. The prediction of electromagnetic waves is one of the most spectacular examples of this power. Certain others, such as the prediction of antimatter, will be discussed in later modules. ",
