From Maxwell\u2019s first equation we obtain a special form of Coulomb\u2019s law known as Gauss\u2019s law for electricity.   \n2. Magnetic field lines are continuous, having no beginning or end. No magnetic monopoles are known to exist. The strength of the magnetic force is related to the magnetic constant $\\mu _ { 0 }$ , also known as the permeability of free space.

The direction of the emf opposes the change. This third of Maxwell\u2019s equations is Faraday\u2019s law of induction, and includes Lenz\u2019s law.   \n4. Magnetic fields are generated by moving charges or by changing electric fields.
