        "text": "Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1963. Their quaint name was taken by Gell-Mann from a James Joyce novel\u2014Gell-Mann was also largely responsible for the concept and name of strangeness. (Whimsical names are common in particle physics, reflecting the personalities of modern physicists.) Originally, three quark types\u2014or flavors\u2014were proposed to account for the then-known mesons and baryons. These quark flavors are named up $( \\boldsymbol { u } )$ , down $( d )$ , and strange (s). All quarks have half-integral spin and are thus fermions. All mesons have integral spin while all baryons have half-integral spin. Therefore, mesons should be made up of an even number of quarks while baryons need to be made up of an odd number of quarks. Figure 33.15 shows the quark substructure of the proton, neutron, and two pions. The most radical proposal by Gell-Mann and Zweig is the fractional charges of quarks, which are $\\pm \\big ( \\frac { 2 } { 3 } \\big ) q _ { e }$ and $\\Big ( \\frac { 1 } { 3 } \\Big ) q _ { e }$ , whereas all directly observed particles have charges that are integral multiples of $q _ { e }$ . Note that the fractional value of the quark does not violate the fact that the eis the smallest unit of charge that is observed, because a free quark cannot exist. Table 33.3 lists characteristics of the six quark flavors that are now thought to exist. Discoveries made since 1963 have required extra quark flavors, which are divided into three families quite analogous to leptons. ",

Quarks obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Similar comments apply to the neutron $\\boldsymbol { n }$ , which is composed of the three quarks ud .

        "text": "The quark model actually lost some of its early popularity because the original model with three quarks had to be modified. The up and down quarks seemed to compose normal matter as seen in Table 33.4, while the single strange quark explained strangeness. Why didn\u2019t it have a counterpart? A fourth quark flavor called charm (c) was proposed as the counterpart of the strange quark to make things symmetric\u2014there would be two normal quarks (u and d) and two exotic quarks (sand c). Furthermore, at that time only four leptons were known, two normal and two exotic. It was attractive that there would be four quarks and four leptons. The problem was that no known particles contained a charmed quark. Suddenly, in November of 1974, two groups (one headed by C. C. Ting at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the other by Burton Richter at SLAC) independently and nearly simultaneously discovered a new meson with characteristics that made it clear that its substructure is $c \\overline { { c } }$ . It was called Jby one group and psi $( \\psi )$ by the other and now is known as the meson. Since then, numerous particles have been discovered containing the charmed quark, consistent in every way with the quark model. The discovery of the meson had such a rejuvenating effect on quark theory that it is now called the November Revolution. Ting and Richter shared the 1976 Nobel Prize. ",

        "text": "History quickly repeated itself. In 1975, the tau $( \\tau )$ was discovered, and a third family of leptons emerged as seen in Table 33.2). Theorists quickly proposed two more quark flavors called top $\\mathbf { \\eta } ( t )$ or truth and bottom $( b )$ or beauty to keep the number of quarks the same as the number of leptons. And in 1976, the upsilon $( r )$ meson was discovered and shown to be composed of a bottom and an antibottom quark or $b \\overline { { b } }$ , quite analogous to the $J / \\psi$ being $c \\overline { { c } }$ as seen in Table 33.4. Being a single flavor, these mesons are sometimes called bare charm and bare bottom and reveal the characteristics of their quarks most clearly. Other mesons containing bottom quarks have since been observed. In 1995, two groups at Fermilab confirmed the top quark\u2019s existence, completing the picture of six quarks listed in Table 33.3. Each successive quark discovery\u2014first $c$ , then $b$ , and finally \u2014has required higher energy because each has higher mass. Quark masses in Table 33.3 are only approximately known, because they are not directly observed. They must be inferred from the masses of the particles they combine to form. ",

        "text": "As mentioned and shown in Figure 33.15, quarks carry another quantum number, which we call color. Of course, it is not the color we sense with visible light, but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors. Specifically, a quark can have one of three color values we call red $( R )$ , green $( G )$ , and blue $( B )$ in analogy to those primary visible colors. Antiquarks have three values we call antired or cyan $\\left( { \\overline { { R } } } \\right)$ , antigreen or magenta $\\left( { \\overline { { G } } } \\right)$ , and antiblue or yellow $\\left( { \\overline { { B } } } \\right)$ in analogy to those secondary visible colors. The reason for these names is that when certain visual colors are combined, the eye sees white. The analogy of the colors combining to white is used to explain why baryons are made of three quarks, why mesons are a quark and an antiquark, and why we cannot isolate a single quark. The force between the quarks is such that their combined colors produce white. This is illustrated in Figure 33.19. A baryon must have one of each primary color or RGB, which produces white. A meson must have a primary color and its anticolor, also producing white. ",

Quark color is thought to be similar to charge, but with more values. An ion, by analogy, exerts much stronger forces than a neutral molecule. When the color of a combination of quarks is white, it is like a neutral atom. The forces a white particle exerts are like the polarization forces in molecules, but in hadrons these leftovers are the strong nuclear force. When a combination of quarks has color other than white, it exerts extremelylarge forces\u2014even larger than the strong force\u2014and perhaps cannot be stable or permanently ",

Gravity is special among the four forces in that it affects the space and time in which the other forces exist and is proving most difficult to include in a Theory of Everything or TOE (to stub the pretension of such a theory). Gravity is thus often set apart. It is not certain that there is meaning in the groupings shown in Figure 33.20, but the analogies are tempting. In the past, we have been able to make significant advances by looking for analogies and patterns, and this is an example of one under current scrutiny. There are connections between the families of leptons, in that the $\\tau$ decays into the $\\mu$ and the $\\mu$ into the e. Similarly for quarks, the higher families eventually decay into the lowest, leaving only $\\boldsymbol { u }$ and $d$ quarks. We have long sought connections between the forces in nature. Since these are carried by particles, we will explore connections between gluons, $W ^ { \\pm }$ and $Z ^ { 0 }$ , and photons as part of the search for unification of forces discussed in GUTs: The Unification of Forces..
