Physicists had long been concerned with how forces are transmitted, finding the concept of fields, such as electric and magnetic fields to be very useful. A field surrounds an object and carries the force exerted by the object through space. Yukawa was interested in the strong nuclear force in particular and found an ingenious way to explain its short range. His idea is a blend of particles, forces, relativity, and quantum mechanics that is applicable to all forces. Yukawa proposed that force is transmitted by the exchange of particles (called carrier particles). The field consists of these carrier particles. ",

The pion is created through a temporary violation of conservation of mass-energy and travels from the proton to the neutron and is recaptured. It is not directly observable and is called a virtual particle. Note that the proton and neutron change identity in the process. The range of the force is limited by the fact that the pion can only exist for the short time allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Yukawa used the finite range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion; the shorter the range, the larger the mass of the carrier particle. "

This allows the temporary creation of a particle of mass $m$ , where $\\Delta E = m c ^ { 2 }$ . The larger the mass and the greater the $\\Delta E$ , the shorter is the time it can exist. This means the range of the force is limited, because the particle can only travel a limited distance in a finite amount of time. In fact, the maximum distance is $d \\approx c \\Delta t$ , where $c$ is the speed of light. The pion must then be captured and, thus, cannot be directly observed because that would amount to a permanent violation of mass-energy conservation. Such particles (like the pion above) are called virtual particles, because they cannot be directly observed but their efectscan be directly observed. Realizing all this, Yukawa used the information on the range of the strong nuclear force to estimate the mass of the pion, the particle that carries it. The steps of his reasoning are approximately retraced in the following worked example: ",

If sufficient energy is in a nucleus, it would be possible to free the pion\u2014that is, to create its mass from external energy input. This can be accomplished by collisions of energetic particles with nuclei, but energies greater than $\\scriptstyle 1 0 0 \\mathsf { M e V }$ are required to conserve both energy and momentum. In 1947, pions were observed in cosmic-ray experiments, which were designed to supply a small flux of high-energy protons that may collide with nuclei. Soon afterward, accelerators of sufficient energy were creating pions in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Three pions were discovered, two with charge and one neutral, and given the symbols $\\pi ^ { + }$ $\\pi ^ { - }$ ,and $\\pi ^ { 0 }$ , respectively.

Since the mass of a muon is around $1 0 6 \\mathrm { M e V } / c ^ { 2 }$ , at first it was thought to be the particle predicted by Yukawa. But it was soon realized that muons do not feel the strong nuclear force and could not be Yukawa\u2019s particle. Their role was unknown, causing the respected physicist I. I. Rabi to comment, \u201cWho ordered that?\u201d This remains a valid question today. We have discovered hundreds of subatomic particles; the roles of some are only partially understood.
