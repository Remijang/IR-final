More recently, the weak nuclear force has been shown to be connected to the electromagnetic force in a manner suggesting that a theory may be constructed in which all four forces are unified.

In the 1960s, a gauge theory, called electroweak theory, was developed by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam and proposed that the electromagnetic and weak forces are identical at sufficiently high energies. One of its predictions, in addition to describing both electromagnetic and weak force phenomena, was the existence of the $W ^ { + } , W ^ { - }$ , and $Z ^ { 0 }$ carrier particles. Not only were three particles having spin 1 predicted, the mass of the $W ^ { + }$ and $W ^ { - }$ was predicted to be $8 1 \\mathrm { G e V } / c ^ { 2 }$ , and that of the $Z ^ { 0 }$ was predicted to be $9 0 \\mathrm { G e V } / c ^ { 2 }$ . (Their masses had to be about 1000 times that of the pion, or about $1 0 0 \\mathrm { G e V } / c ^ { 2 }$ , since the range of the weak force is about 1000 times less than the strong force carried by virtual pions.) In 1983, these carrier particles were observed at CERN with the predicted characteristics, including masses having the predicted values as seen in Table 33.2. This was another triumph of particle theory and experimental effort, resulting in the 1984 Nobel Prize to the experiment\u2019s group leaders Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. Theorists Weinberg, Glashow, and Salam had already been honored with the 1979 Nobel Prize for other aspects of electroweak theory. ",

Like quarks, gluons may be confined to systems having a total color of white. Less is known about gluons than the fact that they are the carriers of the weak and certainly of the electromagnetic force. QCD theory calls for eight gluons, all massless and all spin 1. Six of the gluons carry a color and an anticolor, while two do not carry color, as illustrated in Figure 33.22(a). There is indirect evidence of the existence of gluons in nucleons. When high-energy electrons are scattered from nucleons and evidence of quarks is seen, the momenta of the quarks are smaller than they would be if there were no gluons. That means that the gluons carrying force between quarks also carry some momentum, inferred by the already indirect quark momentum measurements. At any rate, the gluons carry color charge and can change the colors of quarks when exchanged, as seen in Figure 33.22(b). In the figure, a red down quark interacts with a green strange quark by sending it a gluon. That gluon carries red away from the down quark and leaves it green, because it is an $R \\overline { { G } }$ (red-antigreen) gluon. (Taking antigreen away leaves you green.) Its antigreenness kills the green in the strange quark, and its redness turns the quark red. ",

But experiments show that at extremely small distances, the strengths of the forces begin to become more similar. In fact, electroweak theory\u2019s prediction of the $W ^ { + }$ , $W ^ { - }$ , and $Z ^ { 0 }$ carrier particles was based on the strengths of the two forces being identical at extremely small distances as seen in Figure 33.24. As discussed in case of the creation of virtual particles for extremely short times, the small distances or short ranges correspond to the large masses of the carrier particles and the correspondingly large energies needed to create them. Thus, the energy scale on the horizontal axis of Figure 33.24 corresponds to smaller and smaller distances, with $\\mathsf { 1 0 0 G e V }$ corresponding to approximately, $1 0 ^ { - 1 8 } \\mathrm { m }$ for example. At that distance, the strengths of the EM and weak forces are the same. To test physics at that distance, energies of about 100 GeV must be put into the system, and that is sufficient to create and release the $W ^ { + }$ , $W ^ { - }$ , and $Z ^ { 0 }$ carrier particles. At those and higher energies, the masses of the carrier particles becomes less and less relevant, and the $Z ^ { 0 }$ in particular resembles the massless, chargeless, spin 1 photon. In fact, there is enough energy when things are pushed to even smaller distances to transform the, and $Z ^ { 0 }$ into massless carrier particles more similar to photons and gluons. These have not been observed experimentally, but there is a prediction of an associated particle called the Higgs boson. The mass of this particle is not predicted with nearly the certainty with which the mass of the $W ^ { + }$ $W ^ { - }$ and $Z ^ { 0 }$ particles were predicted, but it was hoped that the Higgs boson could be observed at the nowcanceled Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Ongoing experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN have presented some evidence for a Higgs boson with a mass of ${ \\mathsf { 1 2 5 } } { \\mathsf { G e V } } ,$ , and there is a possibility of a direct discovery during 2012. The existence of this more massive particle would give validity to the theory that the carrier particles are identical under certain circumstances. ",

Thus, the fact that neutrinos were observed within hours of the brightening of the supernova only places an upper limit on the neutrino\u2019s mass.
