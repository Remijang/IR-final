The range of visible wavelengths is approximately 380 to $7 6 0 \\mathsf { n m }$ . As is true for all waves, light travels in straight lines and acts like a ray when it interacts with objects several times as large as its wavelength. However, when it interacts with smaller objects, it displays its wave characteristics prominently. Interference is the hallmark of a wave, and in Figure 27.3 both the ray and wave characteristics of light can be seen. The laser beam emitted by the observatory epitomizes a ray, traveling in a straight line. However, passing a pure-wavelength beam through vertical slits with a size close to the wavelength of the beam reveals the wave character of light, as the beam spreads out horizontally into a pattern of bright and dark regions caused by systematic constructive and destructive interference. Rather than spreading out, a ray would continue traveling straight ahead after passing through slits. ",

When light goes from a vacuum to some medium, like water, its speed and wavelength change, but its frequency $f$ remains the same. (We can think of light as a forced oscillation that must have the frequency of the original source.) The speed of light in a medium is $v = c / n$ , where $n$ is its index of refraction. If we divide both sides of equation $c = f \\lambda$ by $n$ , we get $c / n = v = f \\lambda / n$ .
