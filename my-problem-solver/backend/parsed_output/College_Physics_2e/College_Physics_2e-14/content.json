            "FIGURE 14.1 Eunice Newton Foote was the first to determine the relationship between carbon dioxide, water vapor, and the potential for global heating. She designed and conducted a number of experiments to uncover the ability of different gases to trap heat, describing what would later be referred to as greenhouse gases.
