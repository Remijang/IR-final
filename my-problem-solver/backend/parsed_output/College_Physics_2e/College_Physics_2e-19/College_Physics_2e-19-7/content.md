# 19.7 Energy Stored in Capacitors

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

List some uses of capacitors.   
• Express in equation form the energy stored in a capacitor.   
• Explain the function of a defibrillator.

Most of us have seen dramatizations in which medical personnel use a defibrillator to pass an electric current through a patient’s heart to get it to beat normally. (Review Figure 19.22.) Often realistic in detail, the person applying the shock directs another person to “make it 400 joules this time.” The energy delivered by the defibrillator is stored in a capacitor and can be adjusted to fit the situation. SI units of joules are often employed. Less dramatic is the use of capacitors in microelectronics, such as certain handheld calculators, to supply energy when batteries are charged. (See Figure 19.22.) Capacitors are also used to supply energy for flash lamps on cameras.

Energy stored in a capacitor is electrical potential energy, and it is thus related to the charge $Q$ and voltage $V$ on the capacitor. We must be careful when applying the equation for electrical potential energy $\Delta \mathrm { P E } = q \Delta V$ to a capacitor. Remember that $\Delta \mathrm { P E }$ is the potential energy of a charge $q$ going through a voltage $\Delta V$ . But the capacitor starts with zero voltage and gradually comes up to its full voltage as it is charged. The first charge placed on a capacitor experiences a change in voltage $\Delta V = 0$ , since the capacitor has zero voltage when uncharged. The final charge placed on a capacitor experiences $\Delta V = V$ , since the capacitor now has its full voltage $V$ on it. The average voltage on the capacitor during the charging process is $V / 2$ , and so the average voltage experienced by the full charge $q$ is $V / 2$ . Thus the energy stored in a capacitor, $E _ { \mathrm { { c a p } } }$ , is

$$
E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } = { \frac { Q V } { 2 } } ,
$$

where $Q$ is the charge on a capacitor with a voltage $V$ applied. (Note that the energy is not $Q V ,$ but $Q V / 2 .$ ) Charge and voltage are related to the capacitance $C$ of a capacitor by $Q = C V ,$ , and so the expression for $E _ { \mathrm { { c a p } } }$ can be algebraically manipulated into three equivalent expressions:

$$
E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } = { \frac { Q V } { 2 } } = { \frac { C V ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } = { \frac { Q ^ { 2 } } { 2 C } } ,
$$

where $Q$ is the charge and $V$ the voltage on a capacitor $C$ . The energy is in joules for a charge in coulombs, voltage in volts, and capacitance in farads.

# Energy Stored in Capacitors

The energy stored in a capacitor can be expressed in three ways:

$$
E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } = { \frac { Q V } { 2 } } = { \frac { C V ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } = { \frac { Q ^ { 2 } } { 2 C } } ,
$$

where $Q$ is the charge, $V$ is the voltage, and $C$ is the capacitance of the capacitor. The energy is in joules for a charge in coulombs, voltage in volts, and capacitance in farads.

In a defibrillator, the delivery of a large charge in a short burst to a set of paddles across a person’s chest can be a lifesaver. The person’s heart attack might have arisen from the onset of fast, irregular beating of the heart—cardiac or ventricular fibrillation. The application of a large shock of electrical energy can terminate the arrhythmia and allow the body’s pacemaker to resume normal patterns. Today it is common for ambulances to carry a defibrillator, which also uses an electrocardiogram to analyze the patient’s heartbeat pattern. Automated external defibrillators (AED) are found in many public places (Figure 19.23). These are designed to be used by lay persons. The device automatically diagnoses the patient’s heart condition and then applies the shock with appropriate energy and waveform. CPR is recommended in many cases before use of an AED.

# EXAMPLE 19.11

# Capacitance in a Heart Defibrillator

A heart defibrillator delivers $4 . 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 }$ of energy by discharging a capacitor initially at $1 . 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ . What is its capacitance?

# Strategy

We are given $E _ { \mathrm { c a p } }$ and $V$ , and we are asked to find the capacitance $C$ . Of the three expressions in the equation for $E _ { \mathrm { { c a p } } }$ , the most convenient relationship is

$$
E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } = { \frac { C V ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } .
$$

# Solution

Solving this expression for $C$ and entering the given values yields

$$
{ \begin{array} { r c l } { C } & { = } & { { \frac { 2 E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } } { V ^ { 2 } } } = { \frac { 2 ( 4 . 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { J } } ) } { ( 1 . 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } { \mathrm { V } } ) ^ { 2 } } } = 8 . 0 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } { \mathrm { F } } } \\ & { = } & { 8 . 0 0 \mu { \mathrm { F } } . } \end{array} }
$$

# Section Summary

# 19.1 Electric Potential Energy: Potential Difference

• Electric potential is potential energy per unit charge.   
• The potential difference between points A and B, $V _ { \mathrm { B } } - V _ { \mathrm { A } }$ , defined to be the change in potential energy of a charge $q$ moved from A to B, is equal to the change in potential energy divided by the charge, Potential difference is commonly called voltage, represented by the symbol $\Delta V$ . $\Delta V = { \frac { \Delta { \mathrm { P E } } } { q } } $ and $\Delta \mathrm { P E } = q \Delta V$   
An electron volt is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of $\mathsf { 1 } \mathsf { V } .$ In equation form, $1 \ \mathrm { e V } \ =$ $\big ( 1 . 6 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \mathrm { C } \big ) ( 1 \mathrm { V } ) =$ $\bigg ( 1 . 6 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \mathrm { C } \bigg ) ( 1 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { C } )$ 二 $1 . 6 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 1 9 } \mathrm { ~ J } .$   
• Mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of a system, that is, $\mathrm { K E + P E }$ This sum is a constant.

# 19.2 Electric Potential in a Uniform Electric Field

• The voltage between points A and B is $\begin{array} { r } { V _ { \mathrm { A B } } = \bar { E } d } \\ { E = \frac { V _ { \mathrm { A B } } } { d } \int ( \mathrm { u n i f o r m } E \cdot \mathrm { f i e l d o n l y } ) , } \end{array}$ where $d$ is the distance from A to B, or the distance between the plates. In equation form, the general relationship between voltage and electric field is

$E = - { \frac { \Delta V } { \Delta s } } ,$   
where $\Delta s$ is the distance over which the change in potential, $\Delta V$ , takes place. The minus sign tells us that $\mathbf { E }$ points in the direction of decreasing   
potential.) The electric field is said to be the   
gradient(as in grade or slope) of the electric   
potential.

# 19.3 Electrical Potential Due to a Point Charge

• Electric potential of a point charge is $V = k Q / r$ . • Electric potential is a scalar, and electric field is a vector. Addition of voltages as numbers gives the voltage due to a combination of point charges, whereas addition of individual fields as vectors gives the total electric field.

# 19.4 Equipotential Lines

• An equipotential line is a line along which the electric potential is constant.   
• An equipotential surface is a three-dimensional version of equipotential lines.   
• Equipotential lines are always perpendicular to electric field lines. The process by which a conductor can be fixed at zero volts by connecting it to the earth with a good conductor is called grounding.

# 19.5 Capacitors and Dielectrics

• A capacitor is a device used to store charge. • The amount of charge $Q$ a capacitor can store depends on two major factors—the voltage applied

and the capacitor’s physical characteristics, such as its size.   
• The capacitance $C$ is the amount of charge stored per volt,or $C = { \frac { Q } { V } } .$   
• The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is $\begin{array} { r } { C = \varepsilon _ { 0 } \frac { A } { d } } \end{array}$ , when the plates are separated by air or free space. $\varepsilon _ { 0 }$ is called the permittivity of free space.   
• A parallel plate capacitor with a dielectric between its plates has a capacitance given by $C = \kappa \varepsilon _ { 0 } \ { \frac { A } { d } } ,$ where $\kappa$ is the dielectric constant of the material.   
• The maximum electric field strength above which an insulating material begins to break down and conduct is called dielectric strength.

If a circuit contains a combination of capacitors in series and parallel, identify series and parallel parts, compute their capacitances, and then find the total.



# 19.7 Energy Stored in Capacitors

• Capacitors are used in a variety of devices, including defibrillators, microelectronics such as calculators, and flash lamps, to supply energy.   
• The energy stored in a capacitor can be expressed in three ways: $E _ { \mathrm { c a p } } = { \frac { Q { \stackrel { . } { V } } } { 2 } } = { \frac { C V ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } = { \frac { Q ^ { 2 } } { 2 C } } ,$ where $Q$ is the charge, $V$ is the voltage, and $C$ is the capacitance of the capacitor. The energy is in joules when the charge is in coulombs, voltage is in volts, and capacitance is in farads.

16. Give the reason why a dielectric material increases capacitance compared with what it would be with air between the plates of a capacitor. What is the independent reason that a dielectric material also allows a greater voltage to be applied to a capacitor? (The dielectric thus increases $C$ and permits a greater $V$ .)
