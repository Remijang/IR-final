For example, a uniform electric field is produced by placing a potential difference (or voltage) $\\Delta V$ across two parallel metal plates, labeled A and B. (See Figure 19.5.) Examining this will tell us what voltage is needed to produce a certain electric field strength; it will also reveal a more fundamental relationship between electric potential and electric field. From a physicist\u2019s point of view, either $\\Delta V$ or $\\mathbf { E }$ can be used to describe any charge distribution. $\\Delta V$ is most closely tied to energy, whereas $\\mathbf { E }$ is most closely related to force. $\\Delta V$ is a scalar quantity and has no direction, while $\\mathbf { E }$ is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction. (Note that the magnitude of the electric field strength, a scalar quantity, is represented by $E$ below.) The relationship between $\\Delta V$ and is revealed by calculating the work done by the force in moving a charge from point A to point B. But, as noted in Electric Potential Energy: Potential Difference, this is complex for arbitrary charge distributions, requiring calculus. We therefore look at a uniform electric field as an interesting special case. ",

This limits the voltages that can exist between conductors, perhaps on a power transmission line. A smaller voltage will cause a spark if there are points on the surface, since points create greater fields than smooth surfaces. Humid air breaks down at a lower field strength, meaning that a smaller voltage will make a spark jump through humid air. The largest voltages can be built up, say with static electricity, on dry days. ",
