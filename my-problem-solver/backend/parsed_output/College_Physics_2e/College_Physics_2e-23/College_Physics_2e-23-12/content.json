Figure 23.46 shows an RLC series circuit with an AC voltage source, the behavior of which is the subject of this section. The crux of the analysis of an RLCcircuit is the frequency dependence of $X _ { L }$ and $X _ { C }$ , and the effect they have on the phase of voltage versus current (established in the preceding section). These give rise to the frequency dependence of the circuit, with important \u201cresonance\u201d features that are the basis of many applications, such as radio tuners. ",
