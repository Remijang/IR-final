The beat frequency is $F _ { \\mathrm { B } } = \\rvert { f } _ { 1 } - f _ { 2 } \\rvert$ , and so it is directly proportional to the Doppler shift $( f _ { 1 } - f _ { 2 } )$ and hence, the reflector\u2019s velocity. The advantage in this technique is that the Doppler shift is small (because the reflector\u2019s velocity is small), so that great accuracy would be needed to measure the shift directly. But measuring the beat frequency is easy, and it is not affected if the broadcast frequency varies somewhat. Furthermore, the beat frequency is in the audible range and can be amplified for audio feedback to the medical observer. ",
