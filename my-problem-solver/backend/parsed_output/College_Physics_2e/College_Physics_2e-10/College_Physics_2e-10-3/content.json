In fact, your intuition is reliable in predicting many of the factors that are involved. For example, we know that a door opens slowly if we push too close to its hinges. Furthermore, we know that the more massive the door, the more slowly it opens. The first example implies that the farther the force is applied from the pivot, the greater the angular acceleration; another implication is that angular acceleration is inversely proportional to mass. These relationships should seem very similar to the familiar relationships among force, mass, and acceleration embodied in Newton\u2019s second law of motion. There are, in fact, precise rotational analogs to both force and mass. ",

That is, $\\scriptstyle I = \\sum m r ^ { 2 }$ . Here $I$ is analogous to $m$ in translational motion. Because of the distance $r$ , the moment of inertia for any object depends on the chosen axis. Actually, calculating $I$ is beyond the scope of this text except for one simple case\u2014that of a hoop, which has all its mass at the same distance from its axis. A hoop\u2019s moment of inertia around its axis is therefore $M R ^ { 2 }$ , where $M$ is its total mass and $R$ its radius.

The moment of inertia depends not only on the mass of an object, but also on its distributionof mass relative to the axis around which it rotates. For example, it will be much easier to accelerate a merry-go-round full of children if they stand close to its axis than if they all stand at the outer edge.
