The most orderly arrangements (most structured) are 100 heads or 100 tails. The least orderly (least structured) is that of 50 heads and 50 tails. There is only 1 way (1 microstate) to get the most orderly arrangement of 100 heads. There are 100 ways (100 microstates) to get the next most orderly arrangement of 99 heads and 1 tail (also 100 to get its reverse). And there are $1 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 9 }$ ways to get 50 heads and 50 tails, the least orderly arrangement. Table 15.4 is an abbreviated list of the various macrostates and the number of microstates for each macrostate. The total number of microstates\u2014the total number of different ways 100 coins can be tossed\u2014is an impressively large $1 . 2 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 0 }$ . Now, if we start with an orderly macrostate like 100 heads and toss the coins, there is a virtual certainty that we will get a less orderly macrostate. If we keep tossing the coins, it is possible, but exceedingly unlikely, that we will ever get back to the most orderly macrostate. If you tossed the coins once each second, you could expect to get either 100 heads or 100 tails once in $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 2 }$ years! This period is 1 trillion $( 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } )$ times longer than the age of the universe, and so the chances are essentially zero. In contrast, there is an $8 \\%$ chance of getting 50 heads, a $7 3 \\%$ chance of getting from 45 to 55 heads, and a $9 6 \\%$ chance of getting from 40 to 60 heads. Disorder is highly likely. ",
