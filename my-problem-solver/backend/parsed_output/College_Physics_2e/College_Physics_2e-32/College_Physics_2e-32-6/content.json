Hundreds of nuclear fission power plants around the world attest to the fact that controlled fission is practical and, at least in the short term, economical, as seen in Figure 32.20. Whereas nuclear power was of little interest for decades following TMI and Chernobyl (and now Fukushima Daiichi), growing concerns over global warming has brought nuclear power back on the table as a viable energy alternative. By the end of 2009, there were 442 reactors operating in 30 countries, providing $1 5 \\%$ of the world\u2019s electricity.

As noted in Fusion, energy is released if the products of a nuclear reaction have a greater binding energy per nucleon ( ) than the parent nuclei. Figure 32.21 shows that is greater for medium-mass nuclei than heavy nuclei, implying that when a heavy nucleus is split, the products have less mass per nucleon, so that mass is destroyed and energy is released in the reaction. The amount of energy per fission reaction can be large, even by nuclear standards. The graph in Figure 32.21 shows to be about 7.6 MeV/nucleon for the heaviest nuclei ( about 240), while is about 8.6 MeV/nucleon for nuclei having $A$ about 120. Thus, if a heavy nucleus splits in half, then about 1 MeV per nucleon, or approximately $2 4 0 \\mathsf { M e V }$ per fission, is released.

Being chargeless, even low-energy neutrons can strike a nucleus and be absorbed once they feel the attractive nuclear force. Large nuclei are described by a liquid drop model with surface tension and oscillation modes, because the large number of nucleons act like atoms in a drop. The neutron is attracted and thus, deposits energy, causing the nucleus to deform as a liquid drop. If stretched enough, the nucleus narrows in the middle. The number of nucleons in contact and the strength of the nuclear force binding the nucleus together are reduced. Coulomb repulsion between the two ends then succeeds in fissioning the nucleus, which pops like a water drop into two large pieces and a few neutrons. Neutron-induced fission can be written as ",

When a neutron encounters a nucleus with an odd number of neutrons, the nuclear force is more attractive, because the additional neutron will make the number even. About 2-MeV more energy is deposited in the resulting nucleus than would be the case if the number of neutrons was already even. This extra energy produces greater deformation, making fission more likely. Thus, $^ { 2 3 5 } \\mathrm { U }$ and $^ { 2 3 9 } \\mathrm { P u }$ are superior fission fuels. The isotope $^ { 2 3 5 } \\mathrm { U }$ is only $0 . 7 2 \\%$ of natural uranium, while $^ { 2 3 8 } \\mathrm { U }$ is $9 9 . 2 7 \\%$ , and $^ { 2 3 9 } \\mathrm { P u }$ does not exist in nature.

Another interesting characteristic of $^ { 2 3 5 } \\mathrm { U }$ is that it preferentially absorbs very slow moving neutrons (with energies a fraction of an eV), whereas fission reactions produce fast neutrons with energies in the order of an MeV. To make a self-sustained fission reactor with $^ { 2 3 5 } \\mathrm { U }$ , it is thus necessary to slow down (\u201cthermalize\u201d) the neutrons.

But, it is only one-fourth the energy produced by the fusion of a kilogram mixture of deuterium and tritium as seen in Example 32.2. Even though each fission reaction yields about ten times the energy of a fusion reaction, the energy per kilogram of fission fuel is less, because there are far fewer moles per kilogram of the heavy nuclides. Fission fuel is also much more scarce than fusion fuel, and less than $1 \\%$ of uranium $^ { 2 3 5 } \\mathrm { U }$ is readily usable. ",
