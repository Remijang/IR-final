The field is perpendicular to the electron drift velocity and to the width of the conductor. Note that conventional current is to the right in both parts of the figure. In part (a), electrons carry the current and move to the left. In part (b), positive charges carry the current and move to the right. Moving electrons feel a magnetic force toward one side of the conductor, leaving a net positive charge on the other side. This separation of charge createsavoltage $\\varepsilon$ , known as the Hall emf, acros the conductor. The creation of a voltage acros a current-carrying conductor by a magnetic field is known as the Hall effect, after Edwin Hall, the American physicist who discovered it in 1879. ",

Note that in Figure 22.26(b), where positive charges carry the current, the Hall emf has the sign opposite to when negative charges carry the current. Historically, the Hall effect was used to show that electrons carry current in metals and it also shows that positive charges carry current in some semiconductors. The Hall effect is used today as a research tool to probe the movement of charges, their drift velocities and densities, and so on, in materials. In 1980, it was discovered that the Hall effect is quantized, an example of quantum behavior in a macroscopic object. ",

Although the magnetic force moves negative charges to one side, they cannot build up without limit.

A magnetic field applied perpendicular to the flow direction produces a Hall emf $\\varepsilon$ as shown. Note that the sign of $\\varepsilon$ depends not on the sign of the charges, but only on the directions of $B$ and $v$ .
