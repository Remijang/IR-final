(This will lead to a useful equation for the torque on the loop.) We take the magnetic field to be uniform over the rectangular loop, which has width $w$ and height . First, we note that the forces on the top and bottom segments are vertical and, therefore, parallel to the shaft, producing no torque. Those vertical forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that they also produce no net force on the loop. Figure 22.34 shows views of the loop from above. Torque is defined as $\\boldsymbol { \\tau } = \\boldsymbol { r } \\boldsymbol { F }$ sin $\\theta$ , where $F$ is the force, $r$ is the distance from the pivot that the force is applied, and $\\theta$ is the angle between $r$ and $F$ . As seen in Figure 22.34(a), right hand rule 1 gives the forces on the sides to be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that the net force is again zero. However, each force produces a clockwise torque. Since $r = w / 2$ , the torque on each vertical segment is $( w / 2 ) F$ sin $\\theta$ , and the two add to give a total torque. ",

Figure 22.36 shows that a meter is very similar in construction to a motor. The meter in the figure has its magnets shaped to limit the effect of $\\theta$ by making $B$ perpendicular to the loop over a large angular range. Thus the torque is proportional to $I$ and not $\\theta _ { \\cdot }$ . A linear spring exerts a counter-torque that balances the current-produced torque. This makes the needle deflection proportional to $I$ . If an exact proportionality cannot be achieved, the gauge reading can be calibrated. To produce a galvanometer for use in analog voltmeters and ammeters that have a low resistance and respond to small currents, we use a large loop area $A$ , high magnetic field $B$ , and low-resistance coils.
