By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe some applications of magnetism.

# Mass Spectrometry

The curved paths followed by charged particles in magnetic fields can be put to use. A charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field travels in a circular path having a radius $r$ .

$$
r = { \frac { m v } { q B } }
$$

It was noted that this relationship could be used to measure the mass of charged particles such as ions. A mass spectrometer is a device that measures such masses. Most mass spectrometers use magnetic fields for this purpose, although some of them have extremely sophisticated designs. Since there are five variables in the relationship, there are many possibilities. However, if $v , q .$ , and $B$ can be fixed, then the radius of the path $r$ is simply proportional to the mass of the charged particle. Let us examine one such mass spectrometer that has a relatively simple design. (See Figure 22.41.) The process begins with an ion source, a device like an electron gun. The ion source gives ions their charge, accelerates them to some velocity $v$ , and directs a beam of them into the next stage of the spectrometer. This next region is a velocityselectorthat only allows particles with a particular value of $v$ to get through.

The velocity selector has both an electric field and a magnetic field, perpendicular to one another, producing forces in opposite directions on the ions. Only those ions for which the forces balance travel in a straight line into the next region. If the forces balance, then the electric force $F = q E$ equals the magnetic force ${ \boldsymbol { F } } = q v { \boldsymbol { B } }$ , so that $q E = q v B$ . Noting that $q$ cancels, we see that

$$
v = { \frac { E } { B } }
$$

is the velocity particles must have to make it through the velocity selector, and further, that $v$ can be selected by varying $E$ and $B$ . In the final region, there is only a uniform magnetic field, and so the charged particles move in circular arcs with radii proportional to particle mass. The paths also depend on charge $q$ , but since $q$ is in multiples of electron charges, it is easy to determine and to discriminate between ions in different charge states.

Mass spectrometry today is used extensively in chemistry and biology laboratories to identify chemical and biological substances according to their mass-to-charge ratios. In medicine, mass spectrometers are used to measure the concentration of isotopes used as tracers. Usually, biological molecules such as proteins are very large, so they are broken down into smaller fragments before analyzing. Recently, large virus particles have been analyzed as a whole on mass spectrometers. Sometimes a gas chromatograph or high-performance liquid chromatograph provides an initial separation of the large molecules, which are then input into the mass spectrometer.

# Cathode Ray Tubes—CRTs—and the Like

What do non-flat-screen TVs, old computer monitors, x-ray machines, and the 2-mile-long Stanford Linear Accelerator have in common? All of them accelerate electrons, making them different versions of the electron gun. Many of these devices use magnetic fields to steer the accelerated electrons. Figure 22.42 shows the construction of the type of cathode ray tube (CRT) found in some TVs, oscilloscopes, and old computer monitors. Two pairs of coils are used to steer the electrons, one vertically and the other horizontally, to their desired destination.

# Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most useful and rapidly growing medical imaging tools. It noninvasively produces two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with none of the hazards of x-rays. MRI is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in which an externally applied magnetic field interacts with the nuclei of certain atoms, particularly those of hydrogen (protons). These nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields, similar to those of electrons and the current loops discussed earlier in this chapter.

When placed in an external magnetic field, such nuclei experience a torque that pushes or aligns the nuclei into one of two new energy states—depending on the orientation of its spin (analogous to the N pole and S pole in a bar magnet). Transitions from the lower to higher energy state can be achieved by using an external radio frequency signal to “flip” the orientation of the small magnets. (This is actually a quantum mechanical process. The direction of the nuclear magnetic field is quantized as is energy in the radio waves. We will return to these topics in later chapters.) The specific frequency of the radio waves that are absorbed and reemitted depends sensitively on the type of nucleus, the chemical environment, and the external magnetic field strength. Therefore, this is a resonance phenomenon in which nucleiin a magneticfield act like resonators (analogous to those discussed in the treatment of sound in Oscillatory Motion and Waves) that absorb and reemit only certain frequencies. Hence, the phenomenon is namednuclearmagneticresonance(NMR).

NMR has been used for more than 50 years as an analytical tool. It was formulated in 1946 by F. Bloch and E. Purcell, with the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics going to them for their work. Over the past two decades, NMR has been developed to produce detailed images in a process now called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a name coined to avoid the use of the word “nuclear” and the concomitant implication that nuclear radiation is involved. (It is not.) The 2003 Nobel Prize in Medicine went to P. Lauterbur and P. Mansfield for their work with MRI applications.

The largest part of the MRI unit is a superconducting magnet that creates a magnetic field, typically between 1 and $2 \intercal$ in strength, over a relatively large volume. MRI images can be both highly detailed and informative about structures and organ functions. It is helpful that normal and non-normal tissues respond differently for slight changes in the magnetic field. In most medical images, the protons that are hydrogen nuclei are imaged. (About 2/3 of the atoms in the body are hydrogen.) Their location and density give a variety of medically useful information, such as organ function, the condition of tissue (as in the brain), and the shape of structures, such as vertebral disks and knee-joint surfaces. MRI can also be used to follow the movement of certain ions across membranes, yielding information on active transport, osmosis, dialysis, and other phenomena. With excellent spatial resolution, MRI can provide information about tumors, strokes, shoulder injuries, infections, etc.

An image requires position information as well as the density of a nuclear type (usually protons). By varying the magnetic field slightly over the volume to be imaged, the resonant frequency of the protons is made to vary with position. Broadcast radio frequencies are swept over an appropriate range and nuclei absorb and reemit them only if the nuclei are in a magnetic field with the correct strength. The imaging receiver gathers information through the body almost point by point, building up a tissue map. The reception of reemitted radio waves as a function of frequency thus gives position information. These “slices” or cross sections through the body are only several mm thick. The intensity of the reemitted radio waves is proportional to the concentration of the nuclear type being flipped, as well as information on the chemical environment in that area of the body. Various techniques are

available for enhancing contrast in images and for obtaining more information. Scans called T1, T2, or proton density scans rely on different relaxation mechanisms of nuclei. Relaxation refers to the time it takes for the protons to return to equilibrium after the external field is turned off. This time depends upon tissue type and status (such as inflammation).

While MRI images are superior to x rays for certain types of tissue and have none of the hazards of x rays, they do not completely supplant x-ray images. MRI is less effective than x rays for detecting breaks in bone, for example, and in imaging breast tissue, so the two diagnostic tools complement each other. MRI images are also expensive compared to simple x-ray images and tend to be used most often where they supply information not readily obtained from x rays. Another disadvantage of MRI is that the patient is totally enclosed with detectors close to the body for about 30 minutes or more, leading to claustrophobia. It is also difficult for the obese patient to be in the magnet tunnel. New “open-MRI” machines are now available in which the magnet does not completely surround the patient.

Over the last decade, the development of much faster scans, called “functional MRI” (fMRI), has allowed us to map the functioning of various regions in the brain responsible for thought and motor control. This technique measures the change in blood flow for activities (thought, experiences, action) in the brain. The nerve cells increase their consumption of oxygen when active. Blood hemoglobin releases oxygen to active nerve cells and has somewhat different magnetic properties when oxygenated than when deoxygenated. With MRI, we can measure this and detect a blood oxygen-dependent signal. Most of the brain scans today use fMRI.

# Other Medical Uses of Magnetic Fields

Currents in nerve cells and the heart create magnetic fields like any other currents. These can be measured but with some difficulty since their strengths are about $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ to $1 0 ^ { - 8 }$ les than the Earth’s magnetic field. Recording of the heart’s magnetic field as it beats is called a magnetocardiogram (MCG), while measurements of the brain’s magnetic field is called a magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Both give information that differs from that obtained by measuring the electric fields of these organs (ECGs and EEGs), but they are not yet of sufficient importance to make these difficult measurements common.

In both of these techniques, the sensors do not touch the body. MCG can be used in fetal studies, and is probably more sensitive than echocardiography. MCG also looks at the heart’s electrical activity whose voltage output is too small to be recorded by surface electrodes as in EKG. It has the potential of being a rapid scan for early diagnosis of cardiac ischemia (obstruction of blood flow to the heart) or problems with the fetus.

MEG can be used to identify abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that produce weak magnetic signals. Therefore, it looks at brain activity, not just brain structure. It has been used for studies of Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. Advances in instrumentation to measure very small magnetic fields have allowed these two techniques to be used more in recent years. What is used is a sensor called a SQUID, for superconducting quantum interference device. This operates at liquid helium temperatures and can measure magnetic fields thousands of times smaller than the Earth’s.

Finally, there is a burgeoning market for magnetic cures in which magnets are applied in a variety of ways to the body, from magnetic bracelets to magnetic mattresses. The best that can be said for such practices is that they are apparently harmless, unless the magnets get close to the patient’s computer or magnetic storage disks. Claims are made for a broad spectrum of benefits from cleansing the blood to giving the patient more energy, but clinical studies have not verified these claims, nor is there an identifiable mechanism by which such benefits might occur.

# Section Summary

# 22.1 Magnets

• Magnetism is a subject that includes the properties of magnets, the effect of the magnetic force on moving charges and currents, and the creation of magnetic fields by currents.   
• There are two types of magnetic poles, called the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.   
• North magnetic poles are those that are attracted toward the Earth’s geographic north pole.   
• Like poles repel and unlike poles attract.   
• Magnetic poles always occur in pairs of north and south—it is not possible to isolate north and south poles.

# 22.2 Ferromagnets and Electromagnets

• Magnetic poles always occur in pairs of north and south—it is not possible to isolate north and south poles.   
• All magnetism is created by electric current.   
• Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, are those that exhibit strong magnetic effects.   
The atoms in ferromagnetic materials act like small magnets (due to currents within the atoms) and can be aligned, usually in millimeter-sized regions called domains.   
• Domains can grow and align on a larger scale, producing permanent magnets. Such a material is magnetized, or induced to be magnetic.   
• Above a material’s Curie temperature, thermal agitation destroys the alignment of atoms, and ferromagnetism disappears.   
Electromagnets employ electric currents to make magnetic fields, often aided by induced fields in ferromagnetic materials.

# 22.3 Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines

Magnetic fields can be pictorially represented by magnetic field lines, the properties of which are as follows: 1. The field is tangent to the magnetic field line. 2. Field strength is proportional to the line density. 3. Field lines cannot cross. 4. Field lines are continuous loops.

# 22.4 Magnetic Field Strength: Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field

• Magnetic fields exert a force on a moving charge $q ,$ ,

the magnitude of which is ${ \boldsymbol { F } } = q v { \boldsymbol { B } }$ sin $\theta$ ， where $\theta$ is the angle between the directions of $v$ and $B$ .   
The SI unit for magnetic field strength $B$ is the tesla (T), which is related to other units by $1 \ { \mathrm { T } } = { \frac { 1 \ { \mathrm { N } } } { { \mathrm { C } } \cdot { \mathrm { m / s } } } } = { \frac { 1 \ { \mathrm { N } } } { { \mathrm { A } } \cdot { \mathrm { m } } } } .$   
The directionof the force on a moving charge is given by right hand rule 1 (RHR-1): Point the thumb of the right hand in the direction of $v$ , the fingers in the direction of $B$ , and a perpendicular to the palm points in the direction of $F$ .   
• The force is perpendicular to the plane formed by and . Since the force is zero if $\mathbf { v }$ is parallel to $\mathbf { B }$ , charged particles often follow magnetic field lines rather than cross them.

# 22.5 Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field: Examples and Applications

• Magnetic force can supply centripetal force and cause a charged particle to move in a circular path of radius $r = { \frac { m v } { q B } } ,$ where $v$ is the component of the velocity perpendicular to $B$ for a charged particle with mass $m$ and charge $q$ .

# 22.6 The Hall Effect

• The Hall effect is the creation of voltage $\varepsilon$ , known as the Hall emf, across a current-carrying conductor by a magnetic field.   
• The Hall emf is given by ${ \varepsilon } = B l v$ $( B , v ,$ and l,mutually perpendicular) for a conductor of width $l$ through which charges move at a speed $v$ .

# 22.7 Magnetic Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor

• The magnetic force on current-carrying conductors is given by $F = I l B \sin { \Theta }$ ， where $I$ is the current, $l$ is the length of a straight conductor in a uniform magnetic field $B$ , and $\theta$ is the angle between $I$ and $B$ . The force follows RHR-1 with the thumb in the direction of $I$ .

# 22.8 Torque on a Current Loop: Motors and Meters

• The torque $\tau$ on a current-carrying loop of any shape in a uniform magnetic field. is $\tau = N I A B \sin \theta$ ， where $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the current, $A$ is the area of the loop, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $\theta$ is the angle between the perpendicular to the loop and the magnetic field.

# 22.9 Magnetic Fields Produced by Currents: Ampere’s Law

• The strength of the magnetic field created by current in a long straight wire is given by $B = { \frac { \mu _ { 0 } I } { 2 \pi r } } ( { \mathrm { l o n g ~ s t r a i g h t ~ w i r e } } ) ,$ where $I$ is the current, $r$ is the shortest distance to the wire, and the constant $\mu _ { 0 } = 4 \pi \times 1 0 ^ { - 7 }$ is the permeability of free space.   
• The direction of the magnetic field created by a long straight wire is given by right hand rule 2 (RHR-2): Pointthethumboftherighthandinthe directionofcurent,andthefingerscurlinthe directionofthemagneticfieldlo pscreated by it.   
• The magnetic field created by current following any path is the sum (or integral) of the fields due to segments along the path (magnitude and direction as for a straight wire), resulting in a general relationship between current and field known as Ampere’s law.

# Conceptual Questions

# 22.1 Magnets

1. Volcanic and other such activity at the mid-Atlantic ridge extrudes material to fill the gap between separating tectonic plates associated with continental drift. The magnetization of rocks is found to reverse in a coordinated manner with distance from the ridge. What does this imply about the Earth’s magnetic field and how could the knowledge of the spreading rate be used to give its historical record?

# 22.3 Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines

2. Explain why the magnetic field would not be unique (that is, not have a single value) at a point in space where magnetic field lines might cross. (Consider the direction of the field at such a point.)

The magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop is given by $B = \frac { \mu _ { 0 } I } { 2 R }$ (at center of loop), where $R$ is the radius of the loop. This equation becomes $B = \mu _ { 0 } n I / ( 2 R )$ for a flat coil of $N$ loops. RHR-2 gives the direction of the field about the loop. A long coil is called a solenoid.   
• The magnetic field strength inside a solenoid is $B = \mu _ { 0 } n I$ (inside a solenoid) where $n$ is the number of loops per unit length of the solenoid. The field inside is very uniform in magnitude and direction.

# 22.10 Magnetic Force between Two Parallel Conductors

• The force between two parallel currents $I _ { 1 }$ and $I _ { 2 }$ , separated by a distance $r$ , has a magnitude per unit length given by ${ \frac { F } { l } } = { \frac { \mu _ { 0 } I _ { 1 } I _ { 2 } } { 2 \pi r } }$   
The force is attractive if the currents are in the same direction, repulsive if they are in opposite directions.

# 22.11 More Applications of Magnetism

• Crossed (perpendicular) electric and magnetic fields act as a velocity filter, giving equal and opposite forces on any charge with velocity perpendicular to the fields and of magnitude $v = \frac { E } { B } .$

3. List the ways in which magnetic field lines and electric field lines are similar. For example, the field direction is tangent to the line at any point in space. Also list the ways in which they differ. For example, electric force is parallel to electric field lines, whereas magnetic force on moving charges is perpendicular to magnetic field lines.

20. Make a drawing and use RHR-2 to find the direction of the magnetic field of a current loop in a motor (such as in Figure 22.33). Then show that the direction of the torque on the loop is the same as produced by like poles repelling and unlike poles attracting.

# 22.10 Magnetic Force between Two Parallel Conductors

21. Is the force attractive or repulsive between the hot and neutral lines hung from power poles? Why?   
22. If you have three parallel wires in the same plane, as in Figure 22.45, with currents in the outer two running in opposite directions, is it possible for the middle wire to be repelled by both? Attracted by both? Explain.

23. Suppose two long straight wires run perpendicular to one another without touching. Does one exert a net force on the other? If so, what is its direction? Does one exert a net torque on the other? If so, what is its direction? Justify your responses by using the right hand rules.

24. Use the right hand rules to show that the force between the two loops in Figure 22.46 is attractive if the currents are in the same direction and repulsive if they are in opposite directions. Is this consistent with like poles of the loops repelling and unlike poles of the loops attracting? Draw sketches to justify your answers.

25. If one of the loops in Figure 22.46 is tilted slightly relative to the other and their currents are in the same direction, what are the directions of the torques they exert on each other? Does this imply that the poles of the bar magnet-like fields they create will line up with each other if the loops are allowed to rotate?
