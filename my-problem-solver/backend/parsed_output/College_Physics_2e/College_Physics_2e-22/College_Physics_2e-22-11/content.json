Most mass spectrometers use magnetic fields for this purpose, although some of them have extremely sophisticated designs. Since there are five variables in the relationship, there are many possibilities. However, if $v , q .$ , and $B$ can be fixed, then the radius of the path $r$ is simply proportional to the mass of the charged particle. Let us examine one such mass spectrometer that has a relatively simple design. (See Figure 22.41.) The process begins with an ion source, a device like an electron gun. The ion source gives ions their charge, accelerates them to some velocity $v$ , and directs a beam of them into the next stage of the spectrometer. This next region is a velocityselectorthat only allows particles with a particular value of $v$ to get through. ",

Their location and density give a variety of medically useful information, such as organ function, the condition of tissue (as in the brain), and the shape of structures, such as vertebral disks and knee-joint surfaces.

MRI images are also expensive compared to simple x-ray images and tend to be used most often where they supply information not readily obtained from x rays.
