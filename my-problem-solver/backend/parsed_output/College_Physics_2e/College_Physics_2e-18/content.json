        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRIC CHARGE AND ELECTRIC FIELD The image of American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) flying a kite in a thunderstorm is familiar to every schoolchild. (See Figure 18.2.) In this experiment, Franklin demonstrated a connection between lightning and static electricity. Sparks were drawn from a key hung on a kite string during an electrical storm. These sparks were like those produced by static electricity, such as the spark that jumps from your finger to a metal doorknob after you walk across a wool carpet. What Franklin demonstrated in his dangerous experiment was a connection between phenomena on two different scales: one the grand power of an electrical storm, the other an effect of more human proportions. Connections like this one reveal the underlying unity of the laws of nature, an aspect we humans find particularly appealing. ",

But Galvani also found that if he joined two metal wires (say copper and zinc) end to end and touched the other ends to muscles, he produced the same effect in frogs as static discharge. Alessandro Volta (1745\u20131827), partly inspired by Galvani\u2019s work, experimented with various combinations of metals and developed the battery. ",
