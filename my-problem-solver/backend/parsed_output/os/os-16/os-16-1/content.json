The idea is simple: instead of having just one base and bounds pair in our MMU, why not have a base and bounds pair per logical segment of the address space? A segment is just a contiguous portion of the address space of a particular length, and in our canonical address space, we have three logically-different segments: code, stack, and heap. What segmentation allows the OS to do is to place each one of those segments in different parts of physical memory, and thus avoid filling physical memory with unused virtual address space. ",

What we need to first do is extract the offset into the heap, i.e., which byte(s) in this segment the address refers to. Because the heap starts at virtual address 4KB (4096), the offset of 4200 is actually 4200 minus 4096, or 104. We then take this offset (104) and add it to the base register physical address (34K) to get the desired result: 34920. ",
