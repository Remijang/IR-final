39.9 Getting Information About Files
Beyond file access, we expect the file system to keep a fair amount of information about each file it is storing. We generally call such data about files metadata. To see the metadata for a certain file, we can use the stat() or fstat() system calls. These calls take a pathname (or file descriptor) to a file and fill in a stat structure as seen in Figure 39.5.  
You can see that there is a lot of information kept about each file, including its size (in bytes), its low-level name (i.e., inode number), some ownership information, and some information about when the file was accessed or modified, among other things. To see this information, you can use the command line tool stat. In this example, we first create a file (called file) and then use the stat command line tool to learn some things about the file.

Here is the output on Linux:

Each file system usually keeps this type of information in a structure called an inode1. We’ll be learning a lot more about inodes when we talk about file system implementation. For now, you should just think of an inode as a persistent data structure kept by the file system that has information like we see above inside of it. All inodes reside on disk; a copy of active ones are usually cached in memory to speed up access.
