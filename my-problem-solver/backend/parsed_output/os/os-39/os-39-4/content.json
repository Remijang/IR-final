As it turns out, each running process already has three files open, standard input (which the process can read to receive input), standard output (which the process can write to in order to dump information to the screen), and standard error (which the process can write error messages to). These are represented by file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Thus, when you first open another file (as cat does above), it will almost certainly be file descriptor 3. ",

The first argument to read() is the file descriptor, thus telling the file system which file to read; a process can of course have multiple files open at once, and thus the descriptor enables the operating system to know which file a particular read refers to. The second argument points to a buffer where the result of the read() will be placed; in the system-call trace above, strace shows the results of the read in this spot (“hello”). The third argument is the size of the buffer, which in this case is $4 \\mathrm { K B }$ . The call to read() returns successfully as well, here returning the number of bytes it read (6, which includes 5 for the letters in the word “hello” and one for an end-of-line marker). ",

As we mentioned above, this descriptor is known as the standard output, and thus is used to write the word “hello” to the screen as the program cat is meant to do. But does it call write() directly? Maybe (if it is highly optimized). But if not, what cat might do is call the library routine printf(); internally, printf() figures out all the formatting details passed to it, and eventually writes to standard output to print the results to the screen.
