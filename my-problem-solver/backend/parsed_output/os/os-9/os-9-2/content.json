Currency allows a user with a set of tickets to allocate tickets among their own jobs in whatever currency they would like; the system then automatically converts said currency into the correct global value.

User B is running only 1 job and gives it 10 tickets (out of 10 total). The system converts A1’s and A2’s allocation from 500 each in A’s currency to 50 each in the global currency; similarly, B1’s 10 tickets is converted to 100 tickets. The lottery is then held over the global ticket currency (200 total) to determine which job runs. ",

        "text": "Another useful mechanism is ticket transfer. With transfers, a process can temporarily hand off its tickets to another process. This ability is especially useful in a client/server setting, where a client process sends a message to a server asking it to do some work on the client’s behalf. To speed up the work, the client can pass the tickets to the server and thus try to maximize the performance of the server while the server is handling the client’s request. When finished, the server then transfers the tickets back to the client and all is as before. ",

        "text": "Finally, ticket inflation can sometimes be a useful technique. With inflation, a process can temporarily raise or lower the number of tickets it owns. Of course, in a competitive scenario with processes that do not trust one another, this makes little sense; one greedy process could give itself a vast number of tickets and take over the machine. Rather, inflation can be applied in an environment where a group of processes trust one another; in such a case, if any one process knows it needs more CPU time, it can boost its ticket value as a way to reflect that need to the system, all without communicating with any other processes.
