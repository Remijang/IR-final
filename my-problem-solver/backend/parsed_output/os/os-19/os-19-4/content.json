Basically, this just means that any given translation can be anywhere in the TLB, and that the hardware will search the entire TLB in parallel to find the desired translation.

Also common are protection bits, which determine how a page can be accessed (as in the page table). For example, code pages might be marked read and execute, whereas heap pages might be marked read and write. There may also be a few other fields, including an address-space identifier, a dirty bit, and so forth; see below for more information. ",
