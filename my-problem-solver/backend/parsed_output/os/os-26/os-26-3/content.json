First, as Stevens suggests [SR05], we wrap the thread creation and join routines to simply exit on failure; for a program as simple as this one, we want to at least notice an error occurred (if it did), but not do anything very smart about it (e.g., just exit). Thus, Pthread create() simply calls pthread create() and makes sure the return code is 0; if it isn’t, Pthread create() just prints a message and exits. ",

When you run a disassembler on an executable, it shows you what assembly instructions make up the program. For example, if we wish to understand the low-level code to update a counter (as in our example), we run objdump (Linux) to see the assembly code: prompt> objdump -d main Doing so produces a long listing of all the instructions in the program, neatly labeled (particularly if you compiled with the $- \\mathfrak { g }$ flag), which includes symbol information in the program. The objdump program is just one of many tools you should learn how to use; a debugger like gdb, memory profilers like valgrind or purify, and of course the compiler itself are others that you should spend time to learn more about; the better you are at using your tools, the better systems you’ll be able to build.
