The drive consists of a large number of sectors (512-byte blocks), each of which can be read or written. The sectors are numbered from 0 to $n - 1$ on a disk with $\\scriptstyle n$ sectors. Thus, we can view the disk as an array of sectors; 0 to $n - 1$ is thus the address space of the drive. ",

However, when updating the disk, the only guarantee drive manufacturers make is that a single 512-byte write is atomic (i.e., it will either complete in its entirety or it won’t complete at all); thus, if an untimely power loss occurs, only a portion of a larger write may complete (sometimes called a torn write).

Specifically, one can usually assume that accessing two blocks1 near one-another within the drive’s address space will be faster than accessing two blocks that are far apart. One can also usually assume that accessing blocks in a contiguous chunk (i.e., a sequential read or write) is the fastest access mode, and usually much faster than any more random access pattern. ",
