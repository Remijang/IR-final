However, it turns out there is another interesting reason to avoid spin locks on some systems: correctness. The problem to be wary of is known as priority inversion, which unfortunately is an intergalactic scourge, occurring on Earth [M15] and Mars [R97]! ",

If T2 starts to run, it will have higher priority than T1, and thus it will run. T3, which is higher priority than T2, is stuck waiting for T1, which may never run now that T2 is running.
