In operating systems, we generally refer to such space as swap space, because we swap pages out of memory to it and swap pages into memory from it. Thus, we will simply assume that the OS can read from and write to the swap space, in page-sized units. To do so, the OS will need to remember the disk address of a given page. ",

In the example, three processes (Proc 0, Proc 1, and Proc 2) are actively sharing physical memory; each of the three, however, only have some of their valid pages in memory, with the rest located in swap space on disk. A fourth process (Proc 3) has all of its pages swapped out to disk, and thus clearly isnâ€™t currently running. One block of swap remains free. Even from this tiny example, hopefully you can see how using swap space allows the system to pretend that memory is larger than it actually is. ",
