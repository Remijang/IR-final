While achieving system security is challenging, there are known design principles that can help. These principles are useful not only in designing operating systems, but in designing any large software system. ",

In any given system, the more detailed particulars of these security goals vary, which implies that different systems will have different security policies intended to help them meet their specific security goals. As in other areas of operating system design, we handle these varying needs by separating the specific policies used by any particular system from the general mechanisms used to implement the policies for all systems.

The virtualization of processes and memory is one helpful mechanism, since it allows us to control the behavior of processes to a large extent. We will describe several other useful operating system security mechanisms in the upcoming chapters. ",
