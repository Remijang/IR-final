For example, Polybius, writing in the second century B.C., describes how the Roman army used “watchwords” to distinguish friends from foes [P-46], an example of authentication based on what you know. A Roman architect named Celer wrote a letter of recommendation (which still survives) for one of his slaves to be given to an imperial procurator at some time in the 2nd century AD [C100] – authentication based on what the slave had. Even further back, in (literally) Biblical times, the Gileadites required refugees after a battle to say the word “shibboleth,” since the enemies they sought (the Ephraimites) could not properly pronounce that word [JB-500]. This was a form of authentication by what you are: a native speaker of the Gileadites’ dialect or of the Ephraimite dialect. ",
