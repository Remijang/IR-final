To service such a request, some event handler will eventually have to issue an open() system call to open the file, followed by a series of read() calls to read the file. When the file is read into memory, the server will likely start sending the results to the client. ",

With a thread-based server, this is no issue: while the thread issuing the I/O request suspends (waiting for the $\\mathrm { I } / \\mathrm { O }$ to complete), other threads can run, thus enabling the server to make progress. Indeed, this natural overlap of I/O and other computation is what makes thread-based programming quite natural and straightforward. ",

And this implies that if an event handler issues a call that blocks, the entire server will do just that: block until the call completes. When the event loop blocks, the system sits idle, and thus is a huge potential waste of resources. We thus have a rule that must be obeyed in event-based systems: no blocking calls are allowed. ",
