Another metric of interest is fairness, as measured (for example) by Jain’s Fairness Index [J91]. Performance and fairness are often at odds in scheduling; a scheduler, for example, may optimize performance but at the cost of preventing a few jobs from running, thus decreasing fairness. This conundrum shows us that life isn’t always perfect. ",
