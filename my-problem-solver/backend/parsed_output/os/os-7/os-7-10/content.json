The first runs the shortest job remaining and thus optimizes turnaround time; the second alternates between all jobs and thus optimizes response time. Both are bad where the other is good, alas, an inherent trade-off common in systems. We have also seen how we might incorporate I/O into the picture, but have still not solved the problem of the fundamental inability of the OS to see into the future. Shortly, we will see how to overcome this problem, by building a scheduler that uses the recent past to predict the future. This scheduler is known as the multi-level feedback queue, and it is the topic of the next chapter. ",
