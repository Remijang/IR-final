Describe the steps involved in prokaryotic gene regulation Explain the roles of activators, inducers, and repressors in gene regulation

The DNA of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome, supercoiled within the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. Proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. For example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon, and transcribed into a single mRNA.

In prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. Repressors and activators are proteins produced in the cell. Both repressors and activators regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sites adjacentto the genes they control.

Repressors prevent transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. Inducers are small molecules that may be produced by the cell or that are in the cell’s environment. Inducers either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate.

# The trpOperon: A Repressible Operon

Bacteria such as Escherichiacolineed amino acids to survive, and are able to synthesize many of them. Tryptophan is one such amino acid that E.colican either ingest from the environment or synthesize using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. These five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon (Figure 16.3). The genes are transcribed into a single mRNA, which is then translated to produce all five enzymes. If tryptophan is present in the environment, then $E$ .coli does not need to synthesize it and the trpoperon is switched off. However, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, the mRNA is transcribed, the enzyme proteins are translated, and tryptophan is synthesized.

The trpoperon includes three important regions: the coding region, the trpoperator and the trppromoter. The coding region includes the genes for the five tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes. Just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site. The promoter sequence, to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription, is before or “upstream” of the transcriptional start site. Between the promoter and the transcriptional start site is the operator region.



The trpoperator contains the DNA code to which the trprepressor protein can bind. However, the repressor alone cannot bind to the operator. When tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trprepressor, which changes the shape of the repressor protein to a form that can bind to the trpoperator. Binding of the tryptophan–repressor complex at the operator physically prevents the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing the downstream genes.

When tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator, the polymerase can transcribe the enzyme genes, and tryptophan is synthesized. Because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the trpoperon is said to be negativelyregulatedand the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trpexpression are negative regulators.

# Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP): A Transcriptional Activator

Just as the trpoperon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the promoter sequences that act as positive regulators to turn genes on and activate them. For example, when glucose is scarce, E.colibacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. To do this, new genes to process these alternate sugars must be transcribed. When glucose levels drop, cyclic AMP (cAMP) begins to accumulate in the cell. The cAMP molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in E.coli. Accumulating cAMP binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (CAP), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons which control the processing of alternative sugars. When cAMP binds to CAP, the complex then binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources (Figure 16.4). In these operons, a CAP-binding site is located upstream of the RNA-polymerase-binding site in the promoter. CAP binding stabilizes the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region and increases transcription of the associated protein-coding genes.

# The lacOperon: An Inducible Operon

The third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducibleoperons, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. The lacoperon is a typical inducible operon. As mentioned previously, E.coliis able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. One such sugar source is lactose. The lacoperon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. The Z gene of the lacoperon encodes beta-galactosidase, which breaks lactose down to glucose and galactose.



However, for the lacoperon to be activated, two conditions must be met. First, the level of glucose must be very low or nonexistent. Second, lactose must be present. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lacoperon be transcribed (Figure 16.5). In the absence of glucose, the binding of the CAP protein makes transcription of the lacoperon more effective. When lactose is present, its metabolite, allolactose, binds to the lacrepressor and changes its shape so that it cannot bind to the lacoperator to prevent transcription. This combination of conditions makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to synthesize the enzymes to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available. It should be mentioned that the lac operon is transcribed at a very low rate even when glucose is present and lactose absent.

# VISUAL CONNECTION

In E.coli, the trpoperon is on by default, while the lacoperon is off. Why do you think this is the case?

If glucose is present, then CAP fails to bind to the promoter sequence to activate transcription. If lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. If either of these conditions is met, then transcription remains off. Only when glucose is absent and lactose is present is the lacoperon transcribed (Table 16.2).
