As water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. In liquid water, hydrogen bonds constantly form and break as the water molecules slide past each other. The water molecules' motion (kinetic energy) causes the bonds to break due to the heat contained in the system. When the heat rises as water boils, the water molecules' higher kinetic energy causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). Alternatively, when water temperature reduces and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon that we do not see when other liquids solidify.

It therefore takes water a long time to heat and a long time to cool. In fact, water's specific heat capacity is about five times more than that of sand. This explains why the land cools faster than the sea.

Buffers readily absorb excess $\\mathrm { H ^ { + } }$ or $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ , keeping the body's pH carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. Maintaining a constant blood $\\mathsf { p H }$ is critical to a person\u2019s well-being. The buffer maintaining the pH of human blood involves carbonic acid $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C O } _ { 3 } )$ , bicarbonate ion $\\left( \\mathrm { H C O _ { 3 } } ^ { - } \\right)$ , and carbon dioxide $( \\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ . When bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, it removes hydrogen ions and moderates $\\mathsf { p H }$ changes. Similarly, as Figure 2.20 shows, excess carbonic acid can convert to carbon dioxide gas which we exhale through the lungs. This prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the blood\u2019s pH. Likewise, if too much $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ enters into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the pH. Without this buffer system, the body\u2019s pH would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy. ",
