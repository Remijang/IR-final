In their 1953 paper, Watson and Crick penned an incredible understatement: \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\" With specific base pairs, the sequence of one DNA strand can be predicted from its complement. The double-helix model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. What was not clear was how the replication took place. There were three models suggested (Figure 14.12): conservative, semi-conservative,anddispersive. ",

After each of the first few generations, the cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated, then centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. During the centrifugation, the DNA was loaded into a gradient(typically a solution of salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. Under these circumstances, the DNA will form a band according to its buoyantdensity: the density within the gradient at which it floats. DNA grown in $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ will form a band at a higher density position (i.e., farther down the centrifuge tube) than that grown in $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N }$ . Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N }$ after they had been shifted from $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ , the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ and $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N }$ . This suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N }$ formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between $^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { N }$ and $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N }$ , and the other corresponded to the band of $^ { 1 4 } \\mathrm { N } \\mathrm { D N A }$ . These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semi-conservative manner. And for this reason, therefore, the other two models were ruled out. ",
