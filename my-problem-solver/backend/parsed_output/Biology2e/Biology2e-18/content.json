            "Figure 18.1 All organisms are products of evolution adapted to their environment. (a) Saguaro (Carnegieagigantea) can soak up 750 liters of water in a single rain storm, enabling these cacti to survive the dry conditions of the Sonora desert in Mexico and the Southwestern United States. (b) The Andean semiaquatic lizard (Potamitesmontanicola) discovered in Peru in 2010 lives between 1,570 to 2,100 meters in elevation, and, unlike most lizards, is nocturnal and swims. Scientists still do not know how these cold-blood animals are able to move in the cold (10 to $\\mathsf { 1 5 ^ { \\circ } C }$ ) temperatures of the Andean night.
