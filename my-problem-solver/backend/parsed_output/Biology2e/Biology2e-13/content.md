# CHAPTER 13 Modern Understandings of Inheritance

INTRODUCTION The gene is the physical unit of inheritance, and genes are arranged in a linear order on chromosomes. Chromosome behavior and interaction during meiosis explain, at a cellular level, inheritance patterns that we observe in populations. Genetic disorders involving alterations in chromosome number or structure may have dramatic effects and can prevent a fertilized egg from developing.
