This law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 2 }$ generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive.

Each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: TI, Ti, tI, or ti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. Because the Tand Ialleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a tor iallele. Only individuals that are t or i will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. As shown in Figure 12.19, you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio.

How would you perform a reciprocal cross for the characteristic of stem height in the garden pea?   \n24. Mendel performs a cross using a true-breeding pea plant with round, yellow seeds and a true-breeding pea plant with green, wrinkled seeds. What is the probability that offspring will have green, round seeds? Calculate the probability for the $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ and $\\operatorname { F } _ { 2 }$ generations.   \n25. Calculate the probability of selecting a heart or a face card from a standard deck of cards. Is this outcome more or less likely than selecting a heart suit face card?   \n26.

Given that axial is dominant to terminal, list all of the possible $\\mathrm { F } _ { 1 }$ and $\\operatorname { F } _ { 2 }$ genotypes and phenotypes from a cross involving parents that are homozygous for each trait. Express genotypes with conventional genetic abbreviations.   \n27.
