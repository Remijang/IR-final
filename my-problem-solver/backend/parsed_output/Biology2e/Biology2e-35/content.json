Parts of the nervous system are involved in determining how hard to push off and when to turn, as well as controlling the muscles throughout the body that make this complicated movement possible without knocking the bar down\u2014all in just a few seconds.

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. A nervous system is an organism\u2019s control center: it processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviors\u2014from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.
