The salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation for digestion. Simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. Recall that the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. The brain prepares these muscles for movement as well. When the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. There are three overlapping phases of gastric control\u2014the cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phase\u2014each requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well. ",

The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food.
