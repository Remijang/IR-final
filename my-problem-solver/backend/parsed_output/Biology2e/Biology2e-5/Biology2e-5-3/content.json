Because ions move into and out of cells and because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium $( \\mathrm { K ^ { + } } )$ and lower concentrations of sodium $( \\mathsf { N a } ^ { + } )$ than the extracellular fluid. Thus in a living cell, the concentration gradient of $\\mathrm { N a ^ { + } }$ tends to drive it into the cell, and its electrical gradient (a positive ion) also drives it inward to the negatively charged interior. However, the situation is more complex for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of $\\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ , a positive ion, also drives it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of $\\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ drives $\\mathrm { K ^ { + } }$ outof the cell (Figure 5.16). We call the combined concentration gradient and electrical charge that affects an ion its electrochemical gradient. ",

Active transport mechanisms, or pumps, work against electrochemical gradients. Small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances that living cells require in the face of these passive movements. A cell may spend much of its metabolic energy supply maintaining these processes. (A red blood cell uses most of its metabolic energy to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels that the cell requires.) Because active transport mechanisms depend on a cell\u2019s metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the ATP supply. ",

This movement transports other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane (Figure 5.19). Many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. This secondary process also stores high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells in order to produce ATP. The potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions translates into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein ATP synthase, and that energy then converts ADP into ATP.
