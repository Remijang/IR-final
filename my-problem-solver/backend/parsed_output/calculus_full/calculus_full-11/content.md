CHAPTER 11

# Vectors and Matrices

This chapter opens up a new part of calculus. It is multidimensional calculus, because the subject moves into more dimensions. In the first ten chapters, all functions depended on time $t$ or position $x$ —but not both. We had $f ( t )$ or $y ( x )$ . The graphs were curves in a plane. There was one independent variable $\cdot x$ or $t$ ) and one dependent variable $y$ or $f ^ { \cdot }$ ). Now we meet functions $f ( x , t )$ that depend on both $x$ and $t$ . Their graphs aresurfaces instead of curves. This brings us to the calculus of several variables.

Start with the surface that represents the function $f ( x , t )$ or $f ( x , y )$ or $f ( x , y , t )$ . I emphasize functions, because that is what calculus is about.

EXAMPLE 7 $f ( x , t ) = \cos ( x - t )$ is a traveling wave (cosine curve in motion).

At $t = 0$ the curve is $f = \cos x$ . At a later time, the curve moves to the right (Figure 11.1). At each $t$ we get a cross-section of the whole $x - t$ surface. For a wave traveling along a string, the height depends on position as well as time.

A similar function gives a wave going around a stadium. Each person stands up and sits down. Somehow the wave travels.

EXAMPLE 8 $f ( x , y ) = 3 x + y + 1$ is a sloping roof (fixed in time).

The surface is two-dimensional—you can walk around on it. It is flat because $3 x + y + 1$ is a linear function. In the $y$ direction the surface goes up at $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ . If $y$ increases by 1, so does $f$ . That slope is 1. In the $x$ direction the roof is steeper (slope 3). There is a direction in between where the roof is steepest (slope $\sqrt { 1 0 }$ ).

EXAMPLE 9 $f ( x , y , t ) = \cos ( x - y - t )$ is an ocean surface with traveling waves.

This surface moves. At each time $t$ we have a new $x { - } y$ surface. There are three variables, $x$ and $y$ for position and $t$ for time. I can’t draw the function, it needs four dimensions! The base coordinates are $x , y , t$ and the height is $f$ . The alternative is a movie that shows the $x { - } y$ surface changing with $t$ .

At time $t = 0$ the ocean surface is given by $\cos ( x - y )$ . The waves are in straight lines. The line $x - y = 0$ follows a crest because cos $0 = 1$ . The top of the next wave is on the parallel line $x - y = 2 \pi$ , because cos $2 \pi = 1$ . Figure 11.1 shows the ocean surface at a fixed time.

The line $x - y = t$ gives the crest at time $t$ . The water goes up and down (like people in a stadium). The wave goes to shore; but the water stays in the ocean.

Of course multidimensional calculus is not only for waves. In business, demand is a function of price and date. In engineering, the velocity and temperature depend on position $x$ and time $t$ . Biology deals with many variables at once (and statistics is always looking for linear relations like $z = x + 2 y$ ). A serious job lies ahead, to carry derivatives and integrals into more dimensions.
