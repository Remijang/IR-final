In the first ten chapters, all functions depended on time $t$ or position $x$ \u2014but not both. We had $f ( t )$ or $y ( x )$ . The graphs were curves in a plane. There was one independent variable $\\cdot x$ or $t$ ) and one dependent variable $y$ or $f ^ { \\cdot }$ ). Now we meet functions $f ( x , t )$ that depend on both $x$ and $t$ . Their graphs are\u0001surfaces instead of curves. This brings us to the calculus of several variables. ",
