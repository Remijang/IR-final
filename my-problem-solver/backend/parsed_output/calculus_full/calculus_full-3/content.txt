CHAPTER 3

Applications of the Derivative

Chapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. This chapter concentrates on using them. Our computations produced  for functions built from  and sin  and cos  . Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer the questions about  that this subject was created for:

1. How does  change when  changes?   
2. What is the maximum value of  Or the minimum?   
3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?

The information in  is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to the point and nowhere else. In Chapter 2,  and  went to zero. Now we want to get them back. The local information explains the larger picture, because  is approximately  times  .

The problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal—the average slope to the instantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points of equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem—which is the local-global connection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where  equals  : Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its derivatives—or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.

It may seem surprising that we learn about  from  : All our work has been going the other way! We struggled with  to squeeze out  : Now we use  to study  : That’s life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from later generations.
