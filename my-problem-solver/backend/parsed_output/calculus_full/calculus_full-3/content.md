# CHAPTER 3

# Applications of the Derivative

Chapter 2 concentrated on computing derivatives. This chapter concentrates on using them. Our computations produced $d y / d x$ for functions built from $x ^ { n }$ and sin $x$ and cos $x$ . Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer the questions about $y = f ( x )$ that this subject was created for:

1. How does $y$ change when $x$ changes?   
2. What is the maximum value of $y ?$ Or the minimum?   
3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?

The information in $d y / d x$ is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to the point and nowhere else. In Chapter 2, $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ went to zero. Now we want to get them back. The local information explains the larger picture, because $\Delta y$ is approximately $d y / d x$ times $\Delta x$ .

The problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal—the average slope to the instantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points of equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem—which is the local-global connection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where $d y / d x$ equals $\Delta y / \Delta x$ : Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its derivatives—or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.

It may seem surprising that we learn about $y$ from $d y / d x$ : All our work has been going the other way! We struggled with $y$ to squeeze out $d y / d x$ : Now we use $d y / d x$ to study $y$ : That’s life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from later generations.
