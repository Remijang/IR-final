The overwhelming importance of $e ^ { x }$ makes this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics. ",

I believe that the equation $d y / d x = y$ has to be emphasized above techniques of integration. The laws of nature are expressed by differential equations, and at the center is $e ^ { x }$ : Its applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering (and more\u2014wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces a differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do. ",
