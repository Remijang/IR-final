CHAPTER 13

Partial Derivatives

This chapter is at the center of multidimensional calculus. Other chapters and other topics may be optional; this chapter and these topics are required. We are back to the basic idea of calculus—the derivative. There is a function  ; the variables move a little bit, and  moves. The question is how much  moves and how fast. Chapters 1–4 answered this question for  ; a function of one variable. Now we have  or  —with two or three or more variables that move independently. As  and  change,  changes. The fundamental problem of differential calculus is to connect  and  to  Calculus solves that problem in the limit. It connects  and  to  In using this language I am building on the work already done. You know that  is the limit of  : Calculus computes the rate of change— which is the slope of the tangent line. The goal is to extend those ideas to

These functions have graphs, they have derivatives, and they must have tangents.

The heart of this chapter is summarized in six lines. The subject is differential calculus—small changes in a short time. Still to come is integral calculus—adding up those small changes. We give the words and symbols for  ; matched with the words and symbols for  : Please use this suBmmary asBa guide, to know where calculus is going.
