0.4 Video Summaries and Practice Problems

This section is to help readers who also look at the Highlights of Calculus video lectures. The first five videos are just released on ocw.mit.edu as I write these words. Sections 0.1–0.2–0.3 discussed the content of three lectures in full detail. The summaries and practice problems for the other two will come first in this section:

4. Maximum and Minimum and Second Derivative   
5. Big Picture of Integrals

That Lecture 5 is a taste of Integral Calculus. A second set of video lectures goes deeper into Differential Calculus—the rules for computing and using derivatives.

This second set is right now with the video editors, to zoom in when I write on the blackboard and zoom out for the big picture. I just borrowed a video camera from MIT’s OpenCourseWare and set it up in an empty room. I am not good at looking at the audience anyway, so it was easier with nobody watching !

I hope it will be helpful to print here the summaries and practice problems that are planned to accompany those videos. Here are the topics:

6. Derivative of the Sine and Cosine 7. Product and Quotient Rules 8. Chain Rule for the Slope of  9. Inverse Functions and Logarithms 10. Growth Rates and Log Graphs 11. Linear Approximation and Newton’s Method 12. Differential Equations of Growth 13. Differential Equations of Motion 14. Power Series and Euler’s Formula 15. Six Functions, Six Rules, Six Theorems

That last lecture summarizes the theory of differential calculus. The other lectures explain the steps. Here are the first lines written for the max-min video.

Maximum and Minimum and Second Derivative

To find the maximum and minimum values of a function    
Solve  to find points  where slope  zero   
Test each  for a possible minimum or maximum   
Example    
The slope is  at  and    
At those points  and 

 is a minimum Look at  second derivative  derivative of  : This second derivative is  :  increases Slopegoes from down to up at  The bending is upwards and this  is a minimum  decreases Slope goes from up to down at  The bending is downwards and  is a maximum

Find the maximum of y.x/ D sin x Ccos x using  The slope is zero when cos  at  degrees  radians That point  has  The second derivative is   this is   is bending down  is a maximum

 when the curve bends up  when the curve bends down Direction of bending changes ata point of inflection where  Which  gives the minimum of  You can write  The slope is  at the minimum point  Then  and  Minimum point is the average of 1, 2, 6 Key for max=min word problems is to choose a suitable meaning for 

Practice Quest¡ions

1. Which  gives the minimum of  Solve  :

2. Find  for  : This is  so the parabola bends up.

3. Find the maximum height of  : Solve  :

4. Find  to show that this parabola bends down.

5. For  show that  at  : Find  :  Check max versus min by the sign of  :

6. At a minimum point explain why  an 

7. Bending down  changes to bending up  at a point of : At this point  Does  have such a point ?

8. Suppose  : What is the maximum of  times  ? This question asks for the maximum of  : Find where the slope  is zero. What is  times  ?

The Big Picture of Integrals

Key problem Recover the integral  from its derivative    
Find the total distance traveled from a record of the speed   
Find Function  total height knowing Function  slope since the start   
Simplest way Recognize  as derivative of a known    
If  then its integral  was  (1)   
If  2x then y D    
Integral Calculus is the reverse of Differential Calculus   
 adds up the whole history of slopes  to find    
Integral is like sum Derivative is like difference

Sums  Differen Notice cancellation  change in height Divide and multiply the differences by the step size  Sum of  y2 »y1 x is still y2 y0 Now let  Sum changes to integral 

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  The integral reverses the derivative and brin»gs back  Integration and Differentiation are inverse operations Fundamental Theorem in the opposite order  KEY What is the meaning of an integral  Add up short

Example  shows increasing speed and slope. Find  :   
Method 1  has the required derivative  (this is the simplest way !)   
Method 2 The triangle under the graph of  has area  1   
From 0 to  ; base  and height  and area D t .6t /: 2   
[Most shapes are more difficult! Area comes from integrating  or    
Method 3 (fundamental) Add up short time steps each at constant speed   
In a step  ; the distance is close to    
 is the starting time for that step and  is the starting speed   
This is not exact because the speed changes a little within time    
The total distance becomes exact as  and sum  integral

Fundamental Theorem Area  has the desired derivative  Reason: y is the thin area under  between  and 

 is the base of that thin “rectangle”  is the height of that thin “rectangle”

This height  approaches  as the base

From 0 to  ; the correct area under  is  : The slope  is and now the starting area  is 9. Same for sums. Notice  in  The sum of  becomes the integral of  The area under  from 0 to  becomes  :
