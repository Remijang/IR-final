Simultaneously, it reads the values of the operands that are embedded in the instruction, and also reads values from the register file. The AGU (address generation unit) extracts all the fields in the instruction, and schedules the execution of the load or store instruction in the next stage of the pipeline. It plays a special role while processing the ldm (load multiple) and stm (store multiple) instructions. Recall from our discussion in Section 4.3.2 that these instructions can read or write to multiple registers at the same time. The AGU creates multiple operations out of a single ldm or stm instruction in the pipeline. The branch unit is used for branch prediction. It predicts both the branch outcome, and the branch target.

Secondly, computing the value of the 32-bit immediate from its 12-bit encoding is essentially a shift (rotate is a type of shift) operation. Both of these operations are executed by the shift unit that has a hardware structure known as a barrel shifter. Once the operands are ready, they are passed to the ALU and branch unit that computes the branch outcome/target, and the ALU result. ",

For example, a branch to a label is an example of a direct branch. It is possible to compute the branch target of a direct branch in the decode stage. ARM also supports indirect branches, where the branch target is the result of an ALU or memory instruction. For example, the instruction ldr pc, [r1, #10] is an example of an indirect branch. Here, the value of the branch target is equal to the value loaded from memory by the load instruction. It is in general difficult to predict the target of indirect branches. In the Cortex-M3 processor, whenever there is a branch misprediction (either target or outcome), the two instructions fetched after the branch are canceled. The processor starts fetching instructions from the correct branch target. ",

Note that in the second cycle, it is not possible for other instructions to execute in the $E$ stage. The pipeline is thus stalled for one cycle. This specific feature reduces the performance of the pipeline. ARM removed this restriction in its high performance processors. The store instruction also takes 2 cycles to execute. However, the second cycle that accesses memory does not stall the pipeline. The processor writes the value to a store buffer (similar to a write buffer as discussed in Section 11.3.3), and proceeds with its execution. It is further possible to issue back to back (consecutive cycles) store and load instructions, where the load reads the value written by the store. The pipeline does not need to stall for the load instruction because it reads the value written by the store from the store buffer. ",
