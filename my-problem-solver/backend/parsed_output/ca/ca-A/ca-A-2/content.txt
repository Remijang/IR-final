A.2 AMD Processors

Let us now study the design of AMD  processors. Recall that AMD processors implement the x86 instruction set, and AMD manufactures processors for mobile devices, netbooks, laptops, desktops, and servers. In this section, we shall look at two processors at both the ends of the design spectrum. The AMD Bobcat processor is meant for mobile devices, tablets, and netbooks. It implements a subset of the x86 instruction set, and the main objectives of its design are power efficiency, and an acceptable level of performance. The AMD Bulldozer processor is at the other end of the spectrum, and is meant for high-end servers. It is optimized for performance and instruction throughput. It is also AMDâ€™s first multithreaded processor, which uses a novel type of core known as a conjoined core for implementing multithreading.
