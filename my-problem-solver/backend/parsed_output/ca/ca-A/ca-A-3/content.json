As of writing this book (2012-13) Intel processors dominate the laptop and desktop markets. In this section, we shall present the design of two Intel processors that have very different designs. The first processor is the Intel $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ AtomTM, which has been designed for mobile phones, tablets, and embedded computers. At the other end of the spectrum lies the Sandy Bridge multicore, which is a part of the Intel $\\textsuperscript { \\textregistered }$ CoreTMi7 line of processors.
