        "text": "Figure B.3 shows the structure of a TPC with two SMs. The geometry controller orchestrates vertex and shape processing on the individual cores. It brings in vertex data from the memory hierarchy, directs the cores to process them, and then co-ordinates the process of storing the output in the memory hierarchy. Moreover, it also helps in forwarding the output to the next stage of processing. The SMC (SM controller) schedules the requests for external resources. For example, it is possible that multiple cores in an SM might want to write to the DRAM memory, or access the texture unit. In this case, the SMC arbitrates the requests. Let us now look at the structure of an SM. ",

        "text": "Each SM has an i-cache (instruction cache), a C cache (constant cache), and a built-in thread scheduler for multithreaded workloads (MT Issue Unit). The 8 SP cores can access the shared memory unit embedded in the SM for communication between themselves. An SP core has an IEEE 754 compliant floating point ALU. It can perform regular floating point operations such as add, subtract, and multiply. It also supports a special instruction called multiply-add, which is required very frequently in graphics computations. This instruction computes the value of the expression: $a * b + c$ . Along with the FP ALU each SP has an integer ALU that can execute regular integer instructions, and logical instructions. Moreover, the SP core can execute memory instructions, and branch instructions. Similar to vector processors, SP cores implement predicated instructions. This means that they dedicate issue slots to instructions in the wrong path; though, they are replaced with nop instructions. The SPs are optimized for speed, and are the fastest units in the entire GPU. This is due to the fact that they implement a very simple RISC like instruction set, which consists mostly of basic instructions. ",

The texture unit can simultaneously process four threads, and fill the triangles produced after rasterization with the texture of the surface associated with the triangles. The texture information is stored in a small cache within the texture unit. Upon a cache miss, the texture unit can fetch data from the relevant L2 cache, or from main DRAM memory. Now that we have described the different parts of a GPU, let us discuss how to perform a computation on a GPU. ",
