We shall first design the data path, and then briefly look at the control path. To implement a data path that supports forwarding, we need to make minor changes to our pipeline stages. These changes will allow the functional units to use their default input values, as well as outputs of subsequent stages in the pipeline. The basic idea is to use a multiplexer before every input to a functional unit. The role of this multiplexer is to select the right input. Let us now look at each of the pipeline stages. Note that we do not need to make any changes to the IF stage because it does not send or receive any forwarded value. ",

We need to choose between the first operand read from the register file, and the value forwarded from the RW stage. We thus add a multiplexer $( M 1 )$ to help us choose between these two inputs. Likewise, we need to choose between the second operand read from the register file, and the value forwarded from the RW stage. To implement forwarding, we add a multiplexer $( M 2 )$ to make a choice between the value fetched from the register file, and the value forwarded from the RW stage (see Figure 10.25). Multiplexer $( M ^ { \\prime } )$ , which is a part of our baseline design chooses between the second register operand and the immediate computed from the contents of the instruction. Recall that the three fields in the instruction packet that save the results of the OF stage are as follows. $A$ saves the value of the first register operand, op2 saves the value of the second register operand ( $^ { r d }$ register in case of a store), and $B$ saves the value of the second operand of the instruction (register or immediate). Recall that we had decided to read all the values that might be required by any instruction in the interest of time. For example, the not instruction does not require the first register operand. Nevertheless, we still read it because we do not have enough time to take a decision about whether to read or not read the register operands. ",

The three inputs that the EX stage gets from the OF stage are $A$ (first ALU operand), $B$ (second ALU operand), and op2 (second register operand). For $A$ and $B$ , we add two multiplexers, $M 3$ , and $M 4$ , to choose between the values computed in the OF stage, and the values forwarded from the MA and RW stages, respectively. For the op2 field, which possibly contains the store value, we do not need $M A  \\operatorname { E X }$ forwarding. This is because the store value is required in the MA stage, and thus we can use $R W \\to M A$ forwarding. This observation allows us to reduce one forwarding path. Hence, multiplexer $M 5$ has two inputs (default and the value forwarded from the $R W$ stage). ",

If there is a load instruction in the EX stage, then we need to check if there is a RAW data dependence between the load instruction, and the instruction in the OF stage. The only RAW hazard that we do not need to consider here is a load-store dependence, where the load writes to a register that contains the store value. We do not need to stall because we can forward the value to be stored from the RW to the MA stage. For all other data dependencies, we need to stall the pipeline by 1 cycle by introducing a bubble. This will take care of the load-use hazard. The circuit for ensuring the Branch-Lock condition remains the same. Here also, we need to inspect the instruction in the EX stage, and if it is a taken branch, we need to invalidate the instructions in the IF and OF stages. Lastly, the reader should note that interlocks always take precedence over forwarding. ",
