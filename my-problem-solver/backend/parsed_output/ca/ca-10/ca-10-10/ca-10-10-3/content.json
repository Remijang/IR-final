No structure is a perfect insulator in practice. There is a small amount of current flow across its terminals, even in the off state. We can have many other sources of such current leakage across other interfaces that are ideally not supposed to pass current. Such sources of current are together referred to as leakage current, and the associated power dissipation is known as leakage power. ",

For example, we do not expect any current flow between the drain and the source of an NMOS transistor in the off state. However, a small amount of current does flow, and this is known as the sub-threshold leakage current. When leakage current flows across a resistive element, it dissipates leakage power. Leakage power is static in nature and is dissipated all the time irrespective of the level of activity in a circuit. ",

Around 10 years ago (as of 2002), when the transistor threshold voltages used to be higher (around 500 mV), leakage power was exponentially dependent on temperature. Hence, a small increase in temperature would translate to a large increase in leakage power. However, nowadays, the threshold voltages are between $\\mathrm { 1 0 0 - 1 5 0 ~ m V }$ . Consequently, the relationship between temperature and leakage has become approximately linear [Sarangi et al., 2014]. ",
