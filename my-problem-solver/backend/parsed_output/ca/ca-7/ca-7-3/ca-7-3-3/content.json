If the clock is 0, then both the inputs to the cross-coupled NAND gates are 1. This maintains the previous value. If the clock is 1, then the inputs to the cross-coupled NAND gates are $\\overline { S }$ and $\\overline { { R } }$ , respectively. These are the same inputs as the basic SR latch. The rest of the operation follows Table 7.2. Note that a clocked latch is typically referred to as a flip-flop. ",
