The only difference is that the second SR flip-flop uses the complement of the clock signal, $\\boldsymbol { C } \\boldsymbol { L } \\boldsymbol { K }$ . The first flip-flop is known as the master, and the second flip-flop is known as the slave. This flip-flop is also known as a master-slave SR flip-flop. Here, is how this circuit works. ",

When the clock signal becomes low (0), then the first flip-flop stops accepting new data; however, the second flip-flop takes the output of the first flip-flop and sets its output accordingly. Thus, new data arrives at the output terminals Q and $\\overline { { Q } }$ when the clock transitions from 1 to 0 (downward clock edge). We thus have created a flip-flop that is edge sensitive. ",

Let us first try to look at a complex solution that augments the clocked edge sensitive SR flip-flop, and then look at simpler solutions. ",
