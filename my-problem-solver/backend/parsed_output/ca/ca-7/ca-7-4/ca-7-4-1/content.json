They after all require fewer transistors. We shall see that the overheads of implementing the circuitry for reading and writing an SRAM cell are non-trivial.

To write a value into the cell it is necessary to set the values of BL and $\\overline { { B L } }$ to A and $\\overline { { A } }$ , respectively, where $A$ is the value that we intend to write.

All the SRAM cells in a row share the word line, and all SRAM cells in a column share a pair of bit lines. To activate a certain SRAM cell it is necessary to turn its associated word line on. This is done by a decoder. It takes a subset of address bits, and turns the appropriate word line on. A single row of SRAM cells might contain 100+ SRAM cells. Typically, we will be interested in the values of 32 SRAM cells (on a 32-bit machine). In this case the column mux/demux selects the bit lines belonging to the SRAM cells of interest. It uses a subset of the bits in the address as the column select bits. This design methodology is also known as 2.5D memory organization. ",

To write 1, BL needs to be driven to 1, and $\\overline { { B L } }$ needs to be driven to 0. However, reading a value is slightly more difficult. The reason is that an SRAM cell needs to charge an entire bit line to the stored value such that it can be read. Since hundreds of SRAM cells are typically connected to a bit line, the bit line has a very high capacitance. Consequently, it will take a long time to charge/discharge the bit line to logical 0 or 1. ",

If the supply voltage is equal to 1 volt, then the bit lines are charged to 0.5 volts. This step is known as pre-charging. Subsequently, the SRAM cells of interest are accessed by setting the corresponding word line. The sense amplifiers simply monitor the difference in voltage between BL and $\\overline { { B L } }$ . The moment the absolute value of the difference exceeds a threshold, the result can be inferred. For example, if we are reading a logical 1, we need not wait for BL to reach 1, and $\\overline { { B L } }$ to reach 0. If the voltage difference between BL and $\\overline { { B L } }$ exceeds a threshold, then we can declare the result to be 1. ",

Pre-charging bit lines is very fast because there are dedicated pre-charge circuits that can pump a large amount of current into the bit lines to enable faster charging or discharging. After pre-charging inferring the stored value from the voltage swing between BL and $\\overline { { B L } }$ is also very fast. This is because the threshold for the voltage swing is much lower than the supply voltage. Given the high capacitance of bit lines, the time to charge/discharge bit lines is very crucial. Hence, if we reduce the amount of the voltage swing that is required to infer the value stored in the SRAM cell, it makes a significant difference. ",
