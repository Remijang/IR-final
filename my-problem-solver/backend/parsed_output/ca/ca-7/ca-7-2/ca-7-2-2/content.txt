7.2.2 Decoder

A decoder takes as input a  -bit binary number and has  outputs. Based on the input it sets one of the outputs to 1.

Let us assume that  is a power of 2. Now any value from 0 to  can be encoded using  bits. Let us thus treat the input as a Boolean representation of one of the outputs  ). For example, if the value of the  -bit input is equal to  , then the  output is set to  . The rest of the outputs are set to 0. Decoders are extensively used in the design of memory cells and other combinational elements such as multiplexers and demultiplexers.

The design of the decoder is shown in Figure 7.9. We show the design of a  decoder that has two inputs and four outputs. Let the inputs be  and  . We generate all possible combinations:  , and  . These Boolean combinations are generated by computing a logical NOT of  and  and then routing the values to a set of AND gates.

Let us now explain with an example. Assume that the input is equal to 10. This means that  and  . We need to set the  output line to 1, and the rest to 0. The reader can verify that this is indeed happening (note that we are counting from 0). The AND gate corresponding to the  output needs to compute  . In this case, it will be the only condition that evaluates to 1.

On similar lines, we can create a generic  decoder.
