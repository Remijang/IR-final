        "text": "Let us consider a p-n junction as shown in Figure 7.2. The p-type region has an excess of holes and the n-type region has an excess of electrons. At the junction, some holes cross over and move to the $n$ region because they are attracted by electrons. Similarly, some electrons cross over and get amassed on the side of the $p$ region. This migration of holes and electrons is known as diffusion. The area around the junction that witnesses this migration is known as the depletion region. However, due to the migration of electrons and holes, an electric field is produced in the opposite direction of migration in the depletion region. This electric field induces a current known as the drift current. At steady state, the drift and diffusion currents balance each other, and thus there is effectively no current flow across the junction. ",

        "text": "Now, let us see what will happen if we connect both sides of the p-n junction to a voltage source such as a battery. If we connect the $p$ side to the positive terminal, and the n side to the negative terminal, then this configuration is known as forward bias. In this case, holes flow from the p side of the junction to the n side, and electrons flow in the reverse direction. The junction thus conducts current. ",
