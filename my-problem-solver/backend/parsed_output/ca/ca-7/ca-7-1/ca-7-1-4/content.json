        "text": "Like the NMOS transistor, we can have a PMOS transistor as shown in Figure 7.4(a). In this case, the source and drain are regions made up of p type silicon. The logic for the operation of the transistor is exactly the reverse of that of the NMOS transistor. In this case, if the gate is at logical 0, then holes get attracted to the channel and form a conducting path. Whereas, if the gate is at logical 1, then holes get repelled from the channel and do not form a conducting path. ",
