        "text": "Semiconductors and electronic devices are thoroughly studied in advanced courses on semiconductor device physics. Readers can refer to the books by Sze [Sze and Ng, 2006], and Streetman [Streetman and Banerjee, 2005] for a deeper discussion on the physics of semiconductor devices. In advanced courses on semiconductor device physics, students typically study the basics of the operations of diodes, transistors, and other semiconductor devices from the point of view of quantum mechanics. After introducing semiconductor devices, we introduced combinational logic gates and sequential logic elements. The simple structures that we introduced in this chapter, are very commonly used. Students should however take a look at the following books [Lin, 2011, Wakerly, 2000, Dally and Poulton, 1998] for getting a thorough understanding of the devices, including their behavior from the perspective of analog electronics. We lastly talk about memories. The book, \u201cIntroduction to VLSI Systems\u201d, by Ming Bo Lin [Lin, 2011] has a fairly in-depth coverage of memory structures. Memory technology, especially DRAM technology, is advancing very quickly. A host of standards, and design styles have evolved over the last decade. A lot of these trends are discussed in the book on memory systems by Jacob, Ng, and Wang [Jacob et al., 2007]. This book is also very useful for professionals who are looking to build commercial systems with state-of-the-art memory technology. ",
