Fifty years ago, the existence of computers was almost unknown to the common man. Computers were visible only in large financial institutions or in top universities. However, today billions of people all over the world have access to some form of computing device. They use it actively, and have found a place for it in their daily activities. ",

We shall observe that there are two perspectives in computer architecture. We can look at computer architecture from the point of view of software applications. This point of view is sometimes referred to as architecture in literature. It is very important for students of computer architecture to study computer architecture from the viewpoint of a software designer because they need to know about the expectations of software writers from hardware. Secondly, it is also important for software writers to know about computer architecture because they can tailor their software appropriately to make it more efficient. In the case of system software such as operating systems and device drivers, it is absolutely essential to know the details of the architecture because the design of such software is very strongly interlinked with low-level hardware details.

Given the software interface, they need to design hardware that is compatible with it and also implement algorithms that make the system efficient in terms of performance and power. This perspective is also referred to as organization in literature. ",

Let us start out by looking at the generic definition of a computer. ",
