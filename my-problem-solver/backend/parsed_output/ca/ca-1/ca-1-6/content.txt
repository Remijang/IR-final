1.6 How to Ensure that an ISA is Complete?

This is a very interesting, difficult, and theoretically profound question. The problem of finding if a given ISA is complete for a given set of programs, is a fairly difficult problem, and is beyond the scope of the book. The general case is far more interesting. We need to answer the question:

Question 3

Given an ISA, can it represent all possible programs?

We will need to take recourse to theoretical computer science to answer this question. Casual readers can skip Sections 1.6.1 to 1.6.6 without any loss in continuity. They can directly proceed to Section 1.6.7, where we summarize the main results.
