Both sides need to implement their side of the contract. The software part needs to ensure that all the programs that users write can be successfully and efficiently translated to basic instructions. Likewise, hardware needs to ensure that all the instructions in the instruction set are efficiently implementable. On both sides we need to make reasonable assumptions. An ISA needs to have some necessary properties and some desirable properties for efficiency. Let us first look at a property, which is absolutely necessary. ",
