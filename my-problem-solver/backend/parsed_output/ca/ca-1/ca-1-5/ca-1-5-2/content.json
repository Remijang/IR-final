        "text": "We should ideally not have a lot of instructions. We shall see in Chapter 9 that it takes a fairly non-trivial amount of hardware to implement an instruction. Implementing a lot of instructions will unnecessarily increase the number of transistors in the processor and increase its complexity. Consequently, most instruction sets have somewhere between 64 to 1000 instructions. For example, the MIPS instruction set contains 64 instructions, whereas the Intel x86 instruction set has roughly 1000 instructions as of 2024. Note that 1000 is considered a fairly large number for the number of instructions in an ISA. ",
