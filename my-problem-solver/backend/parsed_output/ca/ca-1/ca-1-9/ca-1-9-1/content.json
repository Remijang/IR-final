Ideally, an ISA should be complete, concise, simple, and generic.   \n6. An ISA is complete, if it is equivalent to a universal Turing machine.   \n7. A practical implementation of any complete ISA requires: (a) A memory to hold instructions and data. (b) A CPU to process instructions and perform arithmetic and logical operations. (c) A set of I/O devices for communicating with the programmer.   \n8. Harvard and Von Neumann architectures are practical implementations of complete ISAs, and are also the basis of modern computers.   \n9. Modern processors typically have a set of registers, which are a set of named storage locations. They allow the processor to access data quickly by avoiding time consuming memory accesses.   \n10. Some early processors also had a stack to evaluate arithmetic expressions, and had accumulators to store operands and results. ",
