The reader can refer to the books by Jan Bergstra [Bergstra and Middelburg, 2012] and Gilreath [Gilreath and Laplante, 2003] to learn more about the theory of instruction set completeness and classes of instructions. The book on formal languages by Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ulmann [Hopcroft et al., 2006] provides a good introduction to Turing machines and theoretical computer science in general. To get a historical perspective, readers can refer to the original reports written by Alan Turing [Carpenter and Doran, 1986] and John von Neumann [von Neumann, 1945]. ",
