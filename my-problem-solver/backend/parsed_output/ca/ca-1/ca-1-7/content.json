        "text": "A broad picture of a practical machine has emerged from our discussion in Section 1.6.7. We have summarized the basic structure of such a machine in Figure 1.10. Let us call this machine as the concept machine. Ideas similar to our concept machine were beginning to circulate in the computer science community after Alan Turing published his research paper proposing the Turing machine in 1936. Several scientists got inspired by his ideas, and started pursuing efforts to design practical machines. ",
