Its block diagram is shown in Figure 1.11. There are separate structures for maintaining the instruction table and the memory. The former is also known as instruction memory because we can think of it as a specialized memory tailored to hold only instructions. The latter holds data values that programs need. Hence, it is known as the data memory. The engine for processing instructions is divided into two parts \u2013 control and ALU. The job of the control unit is to fetch instructions, process them, and co-ordinate their execution. ALU stands for arithmetic-logic-unit. It has specialized circuits that can compute arithmetic expressions or logical expressions (AND/OR/NOT etc.). ",
