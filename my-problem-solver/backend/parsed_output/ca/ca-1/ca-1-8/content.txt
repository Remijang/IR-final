1.8 The Road Ahead

We have outlined the structure of a modern machine in Section 1.7.3, which broadly follows a Von Neumann architecture, and is augmented with registers. Now, we need to proceed to build it. As mentioned at the outset, computer architecture is a beautiful amalgam of software and hardware. Software engineers tell us what to build? Hardware designers tell us how to build?

Let us thus first take care of the requirements of software engineers. Refer to the roadmap of chapters in Figure 1.14. The first part of the book will introduce computer architecture from the point of view of system software designers and application developers. Subsequently, we shall move on to designing processors, and lastly, we shall look at building a full system comprising processors, memory elements, I/O and storage devices.
