We have seen in Chapter 7 that we can design memory elements with four kinds of basic circuits \u2013 latches, SRAM cells, CAM cells and DRAM cells. There is a tradeoff here. Latches and SRAM cells are much faster than DRAM or CAM cells. However, as compared to a DRAM cell, a latch, CAM or SRAM cell is an order of magnitude larger in terms of area, and also consumes much more power. We observe that a latch is designed to read in and read out data at a negative clock edge. It is a fast circuit that can store and retrieve data in a fraction of a clock cycle. On the other hand, an SRAM cell is typically designed to be used as a part of a large array of SRAM cells along with a decoder and sense amplifiers. With this additional overhead, an SRAM cell is typically slower than a typical edge triggered latch. In comparison, CAM cells are best for memories that are content associative, and DRAM cells are best for memories that have very large capacities. ",

This means that given a certain amount of silicon, we can save 160 times more data if we use DRAM cells. However, DRAM memory is also 200 times slower (if we consider a representative array of DRAM cells). Clearly, there is a tradeoff between capacity, and speed. The sad part is that we actually need both. ",

It is definitely possible to supplement the amount of available memory with additional chips exclusively containing memory cells. Keep in mind that off-chip memory is slow, and it takes tens of cycles for the processor to access such memory modules. To achieve our goal of having a 1-cycle memory access, we need to use the relatively faster on-chip memory most of the time. Here, also our options are limited. We cannot afford to have a memory system consisting exclusively of latches. For a large number of programs, we will not be able to fit all our data in memory. For example, modern programs typically require hundreds of megabytes of memory. Moreover, some large scientific programs require gigabytes of memory. Second, it is difficult to integrate large DRAM arrays along with a processor on the same chip due to technological constraints. Hence, designers are compelled to use large SRAM arrays for on-chip memories. As shown in Table 11.1 SRAM cells(arrays) are much larger than DRAM cells(arrays), and thus have much less capacity. ",
