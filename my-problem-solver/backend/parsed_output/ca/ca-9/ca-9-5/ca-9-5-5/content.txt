9.5.5 Memory Unit

The memory unit is shown in Figure 9.21. Like the hardwired processor, it has two source registers – mar and mdr. The memory address register(mar) buffers the memory address, and the memory data register (mdr) buffers the value that needs to be stored. Here also, we require a set of arguments that specify the nature of the memory operation – load or store. Once, a load operation is done, the data is available in the ldResult register.
