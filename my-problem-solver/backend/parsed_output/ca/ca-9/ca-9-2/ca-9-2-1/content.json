If the instruction is a branch, and it is taken, then the new value of the PC needs to be equal to the address of the branch target. Otherwise, the address of the next instruction is equal to the default value (current PC + 4). ",

We can either use an adder and increment the current PC by 4, or we can get the address from another unit that calculates the branch target(branchP C), and the fact that the branch is taken. We can use a multiplexer to choose between these two inputs. Once, the correct input is chosen, it needs to be saved in the pc register and sent to the memory system for fetching the instruction. We can either use a combined memory for both instruction and data (Von Neumann Machine) or use a separate instruction memory (Harvard Machine). The latter option is more common. The instruction memory is typically implemented as an array of SRAM cells. The fetch unit provides the address in the SRAM array, and then uses the 32 bits stored at the specified starting address as the contents of the instruction. ",
