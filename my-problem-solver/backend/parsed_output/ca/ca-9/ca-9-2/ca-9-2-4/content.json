Recall that the SimpleRisc instruction set requires a f lags register that contains the result of the last compare $( c m p )$ instruction. It has two bits $\\mathit { \\Pi } - \\mathit { \\Pi } E$ and $G T$ . If the last compare instruction led to an equality, then the $E$ bit is set, and if the first operand was greater than the second operand then the $G T$ bit is set. For the beq instruction, the control unit sets the signal $_ { i s B e q }$ to 1. We need to compute a logical AND of this signal and the value of the $E$ bit in the f lags register. If both are 1, then the branch is taken. Similarly, we need an AND gate to compute the outcome of the bgt instruction, as shown in Figure 9.8. The branch might also be unconditional $( c a l l / r e t / b )$ . In this case, the control unit sets the signal isU Branch to 1. If any of the above conditions is true, then the branch is taken. We subsequently use an OR gate that computes the outcome of the branch, and sets the isBranchT aken signal. This signal is used by the fetch unit to control the multiplexer that generates the next PC. ",

However, the second operand ( $B$ ) can either be a register or the sign extended immediate. This is decided by the isImmediate signal generated by the control unit. The isImmediate signal is equal to the value of the immediate bit in the instruction. If it is 1, then the multiplexer in Figure 9.9 chooses immx as the operand. If it is 0, then op2 is chosen as the operand. The ALU takes as input a set of signals known collectively as aluSignals. They are generated by the control unit, and specify the type of ALU operation.

Secondly, each module has a dedicated signal that enables or disables it. For example, there is no reason to enable the divider when we want to perform simple addition. There are several ways in which we can enable or disable a unit. The simplest method is to use a transmission gate for every input bit. A transmission gate is shown in Figure 9.11. If the signal(S) is turned on, then the output reflects the value of the input. Otherwise, it maintains its previous value. Thus, if the enabling signal is off, then the module does not see the new inputs. It thus does not dissipate any power, and is effectively disabled. ",

Here, $A$ and $B$ are the values of the source operands. If the isAdd signal is turned on, then the adder adds the operands. Likewise, if the $i s S u b$ signal is turned on, then the adder adds the 2\u2019s complement of $B$ with $A$ . In effect, it subtracts $B$ from $A$ . If the isCmp flag is turned on, then the adder unit subtracts $B$ from $A$ and sets the value of the f lags register. If the output is 0, then it sets the $E$ bit. If the output is positive, it sets the $G T$ bit. If none of these signals (isAdd/isSub/isCmp) is true, then the adder is disabled. ",
