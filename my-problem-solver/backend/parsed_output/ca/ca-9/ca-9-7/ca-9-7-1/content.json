Otherwise, the value of the register does not get reflected on the write bus. For example, the register, aluResult, contains the result of an ALU operation, and it is sometimes necessary to transfer its value to the write bus. The signal $a l u R e s u l t _ { o u t }$ controls the behavior of the aluResult register. We associate similar signals with the subscript, out with all the registers that need to access the write bus. ",

We associate the signal $m a r _ { i n }$ with it. If it is 1, then the value of the data on the read bus is transferred to mar. If $m a r _ { i n } = 0$ , the mar register is effectively disconnected from the read bus. ",
