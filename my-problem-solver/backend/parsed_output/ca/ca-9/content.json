        "text": "We shall start out by describing the basic elements of a processor in terms of fetching an instruction from memory, fetching its operands, executing the instruction, and writing the results back to memory or the register file. We shall see that along with the basic elements such as adders and multipliers, we need many more structures to efficiently route instructions between different units, and ensure fast execution. For modern processors, there are two primary design styles \u2013 hardwired, and microprogrammed. In the hardwired design style, we complicate a simple processor by adding more elaborate structures to process instructions. There is a net increase in complexity. In the microprogrammed design style, we have a very simple processor that controls a more complicated processor. The simple processor executes basic instructions known as microinstructions for each program instruction, and uses these microinstructions to control the operation of the complicated processor. Even though the hardwired design style is much more common today, the microprogrammed design style is still used in many embedded processors. Secondly, some aspects of microprogramming have crept into today\u2019s complex processors. ",
