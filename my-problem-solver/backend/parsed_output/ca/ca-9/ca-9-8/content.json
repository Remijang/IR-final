        "text": "We now arrive at the last piece of our microprogrammed processor, which is the design of the $\\mu$ control unit. It is a simple processor that executes microinstructions. It consists of a \u00b5fetch unit and a \u00b5pc. Every cycle we increment the \u00b5pc by 1 (addressed by the number of the instruction, not by bytes), or set it to the branch target. Then, we proceed to read the microinstruction from the microprogram memory, and process it. There are two main paradigms for designing an encoding of microinstructions, and executing them using a $\\mu$ control unit. The first is known as vertical microprogramming. In principle, this paradigm is similar to executing regular program instructions using a hardwired processor. The second paradigm is known as horizontal microprogramming. This is more common, and is also a more efficient. ",
