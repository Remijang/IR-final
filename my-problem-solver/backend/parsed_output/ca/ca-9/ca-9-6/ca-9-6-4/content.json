Hence, the reader should read this example several times and ensure that she has a clear understanding. The reason that we fuse both the operations is because microcode registers are typically very small, and thus they can be accessed very quickly. Hence, it is not a good idea to use a complete cycle for transferring data between micro registers. It is a better idea to fuse a register transfer with a functional unit operation, such that we can ensure that we are roughly doing a similar amount of work every cycle. ",

We move the contents of the register, $r s 2$ , to the regSrc register that contains the index of the register that we need to read from the register file. Then we move the value of the operand read from the register file $( r e g V a l )$ to the ALU (register $B$ ). Since the value in register $A$ is already present, we can directly start the ALU operation. This is indicated to the ALU by sending an extra argument $( \\langle a l u o p \\rangle )$ that encodes the ALU operation. $\\langle a l u o p \\rangle$ corresponds to one of the following operations: add, sub, mul, div, mod, and, or, lsl, ${ \\mathit { l s r } }$ , and asr.
