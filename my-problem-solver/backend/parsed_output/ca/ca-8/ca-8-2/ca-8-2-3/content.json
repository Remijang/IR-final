We can thus replace $j - i + 1$ additions with one addition and one subtraction. This insight allows us to reduce the number of additions if there are long runs of 1s in the 2\u2019s complement notation of the multiplier. If the multiplier is a small negative number, then it fits this pattern. It will have a long run of 1s especially in the most significant positions. Even otherwise, most of the numbers that we encounter will at least have some runs of 1s. The worst case arises, when we have a number of the form: 010101... . This is a very rare case. ",

The partial product will be the same in both the cases. If we were multiplying $N$ with $M ^ { \\prime }$ , then no action will be taken in the last step because the two MSB bits of $M ^ { \\prime }$ are 00. This means that in the second last step ( $( n - 1 )$ iterations), the partial product contains $N M ^ { \\prime }$ . We can similarly prove that the partial product computed by the iterative multiplier after $( n - 1 )$ iterations is equal to $N M ^ { \\prime }$ because the MSB of $M ^ { \\prime }$ is $0$ . ",

The iterative algorithm subtracts the multiplicand( $N$ ) from $U$ , or alternatively subtracts $N \\times 2 ^ { n - 1 }$ from the partial product. The reason that we treat the multiplicand as shifted by $n - 1$ places is because the partial product in the last iteration spans the entire $U$ register and $n - 1$ bits of the $V$ register. Now, when we add or subtract the multiplicand( $N$ ) to $U$ , effectively, we are adding $N$ shifted by $n - 1$ places to the left. Hence, the iterative multiplier correctly computes the product as $M ^ { \\prime } N { - } 2 ^ { n - 1 } N = M N$ (see Equation 8.11). The Booth multiplier also does the same in this case. It sees a $0  1$ transition. It subtracts $N$ from $U$ , which is exactly the same step as taken by the iterative multiplier.

Let us assume that we were originally multiplying $N$ with $M ^ { \\prime }$ , then the MSB would have been 0, and this fact would have been discovered in the last iteration. The Booth\u2019s algorithm would have then added $2 ^ { n - 1 } N$ to obtain the final result in the last step because of a $1  0$ transition. Hence, after the $( n - 1 ) ^ { t h }$ iteration, the partial product of the Booth multiplier is equal to $M ^ { \\prime } N - 2 ^ { n - 1 } N$ .

Hence, its final product is equal to the partial product computed at the end of the $( n - 1 ) ^ { t h }$ iteration, which is equal to $M ^ { \\prime } N - 2 ^ { n - 1 } N$ .
