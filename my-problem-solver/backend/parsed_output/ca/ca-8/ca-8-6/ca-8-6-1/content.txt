8.6.1 Simple Division

The major difference between integer and floating point division is that floating point division does not have a remainder. It only has a quotient. Let us try to divide  by  to obtain  .

We initialize the algorithm by setting the  register to contain the significand  of  . The  register is initialized as  . This is done because in division, we subtract the exponents. Hence, in their biased representation we need to subtract  from  , and we need to add the value of the bias back. Computing the sign of the result is also trivial in this case.

We start out by dividing  by  . The rest of the steps are the same as that of multiplication (see Section 8.5). We normalize the result, round it, and then renormalize if necessary.

The time complexity of this operation is the same as the time complexity of the restoring or non-restoring algorithms. It is equal to  . It turns out that for the case of floating point division, we can do much better.
