        "text": "Let us now explain the methods of programming multiprocessors. For ease of explanation, let us draw an analogy here. Consider a group of workers in a factory. They co-operatively perform a task by communicating with each other orally. A supervisor often issues commands to the group of workers, and then they perform their work. If there is a problem, a worker indicates it by raising an alarm. Immediately, other workers rush to his assistance. In this small and simple setting, all the workers can hear each other, and see each other\u2019s actions. This proximity enables them to accomplish complex tasks. ",

        "text": "We can alternatively consider another model, where workers cannot necessarily see or hear each other. In this case, they need to communicate with each other through a system of messages. Messages can be passed through letters, phone calls, or emails. In this setting, if a worker discovers a problem, he needs to send a message to his supervisor such that she can come and rectify the problem. Workers need to be typically aware of each other\u2019s identities, and explicitly send messages to all or a subset of them. It is not possible anymore to shout loudly, and communicate with everybody at the same time. However, there are some advantages of this system. We can support many more workers because they do not have to be co-located. Secondly, since there are no constraints on the location of workers, they can be located at different parts of the world, and be doing very different things. This system is thus far more flexible, and scalable. ",

        "text": "Inspired by these real life scenarios, computer architects have designed a set of protocols for multiprocessors following different paradigms. The first paradigm is known as shared memory, where all the individual programs see the same view of the memory system. If program $A$ changes the value of $x$ to 5, then program $B$ immediately sees the change. The second setting is known as message passing. Here multiple programs communicate among each other by passing messages. The shared memory paradigm is more suitable for strongly coupled multiprocessors, and the message passing paradigm is more suitable for loosely coupled multiprocessors. Note that it is possible to implement message passing on a strongly coupled multiprocessor. Likewise, it is also possible to implement an abstraction of a shared memory on an otherwise loosely coupled multiprocessor. This is known as distributed shared memory [Keleher et al., 1994]. However, this is typically not the norm. ",

In this case, it is equal to N. Thus, N copies of the parallel part of the code are launched in parallel. Each copy runs on a separate processor. Note that each of these copies of the program can access all the variables that have been declared before the invocation of the parallel section. For example, they can access partialSums, and the numbers arrays. Each processor invokes the function omp get thread num, which returns the id of the thread. Each thread uses the thread id to find the range of the array that it needs to add. It adds all the entries in the relevant portion of the array, and saves the result in its corresponding entry in the partialSums array. Once all the threads have completed their job, the sequential section begins. This piece of sequential code can run on any processor. This decision is made dynamically at runtime by the operating system, or the parallel programming framework. To obtain the final result it is necessary to add all the partial sums in the sequential section. ",

Once it finishes, all the local variables in its stack are destroyed. To communicate data between the parent thread and the child threads, it is necessary to use variables that are accessible to both the threads. These variables need to be globally accessible by all the threads. The child threads can freely modify these variables, and even use them to communicate among each other also. They are additionally free to invoke the operating system, and write to external files and network devices. Once, all the threads have finished executing, they perform a join operation, and free their state. The parent thread takes over, and finishes the role of aggregating the results. Here, join is an example of a synchronization operation between threads. There can be many other types of synchronization operations between threads. The reader is referred to [Culler et al., 1998] for a detailed discussion on thread synchronization. All that the reader needs to understand is that there are a set of complicated constructs that threads can use to perform very complex tasks co-operatively. Adding a set of numbers is a very simple example. Multithreaded programs can be used to perform other complicated tasks such as matrix algebra, and even solve differential equations in parallel. ",
