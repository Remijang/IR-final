We observed that by optimizing the processor, and the memory system, it is possible to significantly increase the performance of a program. Now, the question is, \u201cIs this enough?\u201d Or, is it possible to do better? ",

        "text": "A short answer to this question is \u201cMaybe Not.\u201d For a long answer to this question, the reader needs to read through this entire chapter, and possibly take a look at the references. Let us start out by saying that processor performance has its limits. It is not possible to increase the speed of a processor indefinitely. Even with very complicated superscalar processors (see Chapter 10), and highly optimized memory systems, it is typically not possible to increase the IPC by more than $5 0 \\%$ . Secondly, because of power and temperature considerations, it is very difficult to increase processor frequency beyond 3 GHz. The reader should note that processor frequencies have remained more or less the same over the last ten years (2002-2012). Consequently, CPU performance has also been increasing very slowly over the last ten years. ",

Figure 12.1 shows the peak frequency of processors released by multiple vendors such as Intel, AMD, Sun, Qualcomm, and Fujitsu from 2001 till 2010. We observe that the frequency has stayed more or less constant (mostly between 1 GHz to 2.5 GHz). The trends do not indicate a gradual increase in frequency. We expect that in the near future also, the frequency of processors will be limited to 3 GHz. ",

        "text": "Even though the performance of a single processor is not expected to significantly increase in the future, the future of computer architecture is not bleak. This is because processor manufacturing technology is steadily getting better, and this is leading to smaller and faster transistors. Till the late nineties processor designers were utilizing the gains in transistor technology to increase the complexity of a processor by implementing more features. However, due to limitations in complexity, and power, designers resorted to using simpler processors after 2005. Instead of implementing more features in processors, vendors instead decided to put more than one processor on a single chip. This helps us run more than one program at the same time. Alternatively, sometimes it is possible to split a single program into multiple parts and run all the parts in parallel. ",
