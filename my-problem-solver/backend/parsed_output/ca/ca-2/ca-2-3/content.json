        "text": "Let us consider the generic problem first. For a number system consisting of a set of numbers, $\\boldsymbol { S }$ (both positive and negative), we wish to create a mapping between each number in $\\boldsymbol { S }$ , and a sequence of zeros and ones. A sequence of zeros and ones can alternatively be represented as an unsigned integer. Thus, putting it formally, we propose to devise a method for representing both positive and negative integers as a function $\\mathcal { F } : \\mathcal { S }  \\mathcal { N }$ that maps a set of numbers, $\\boldsymbol { S }$ , to a set of unsigned integers, $\\mathcal { N }$ . Let us define the function $S g n B i t ( u )$ of a number, $u$ . It is equal to 1 when $u$ is negative, and equal to 0 when $u$ is positive or zero. Secondly, unless specified otherwise, we assume that all our numbers require $n$ bits per storage in the next few subsections. ",
