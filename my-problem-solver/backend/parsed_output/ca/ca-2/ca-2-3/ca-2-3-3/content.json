Then, the actual range of the number system is from -7 to $+ 8$ . Note that this method avoids some pitfalls of the sign-magnitude and 1\u2019s complement approach. First, there is only one representation for 0. In this case it is 0111. Second, it is possible to use standard unsigned binary addition to add two numbers with a small modification. ",

If we add 2 and -2, we are in effect adding the unsigned numbers 5 and 9. $5 + 9$ $= 1 4$ . This is not the right answer. The right answer should be 0, and it should be represented as 0111 or $+ 7$ . Nonetheless, we can get the right answer by subtracting the bias, i.e., 7. 14 - 7 $= 7$ . Hence, the algorithm for addition is to perform simple binary unsigned addition, and then subtract the bias. Performing simple binary subtraction is also easy (need to add the bias). Hence, in the case of addition, for two numbers, $u$ and $v$ , we have: ",
