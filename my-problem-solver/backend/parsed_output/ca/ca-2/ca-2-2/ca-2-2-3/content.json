At that position, we need to add three bits \u2013 two input operand bits and a carry bit. This is shown in Figure 2.5. In this figure, the input operand bits are designated as $A$ and $B$ . The input carry bit is designated as $C _ { i n }$ . The result will have two bits in it. The least significant bit (right most bit) is known as the sum, and the output carry is referred to as Cout.
