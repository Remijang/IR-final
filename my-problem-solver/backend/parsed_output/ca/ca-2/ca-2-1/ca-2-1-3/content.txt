2.1.3 Boolean Algebra

Given Boolean variables and basic operators, let us define some rules of Boolean algebra.

NOT Operator

Let us look at some rules governing the NOT operator.

1. Definition:  , and  – This is the definition of the NOT operator.

2. Double negation:  – The NOT of (NOT of  ) is equal to  itself.

OR and AND Operators

1. Identity:  , and  we compute the OR of a Boolean variable,  , with 0, or AND with 1, the result is equal to  .

2. Annulment:  , and  we compute  OR 1, then the result is always equal to 1. Similarly,  AND 0, is always equal to 0 because the value of the second operand determines the final result.

3. Idempotence:  , and  – The result of computing the OR or AND of  with itself, is  .

4. Complementarity:  , and  – Either  , or  . In either case  will have one term, which is 1, and thus the result is 1. Similarly, one of the terms in  is  , and thus the result is  .

5. Commutativity:  , and  – The order of Boolean variables does not matter.

6. Associativity:  , and  .  – We are free to parenthesize expressions containing only OR or AND operators in any way we choose.

7. Distributivity:  , and  – We can use this law to open up a parenthesis and simplify expressions.

We can use these rules to manipulate expressions containing Boolean variables in a variety of ways. Let us now look at a basic set of theorems in Boolean algebra.
