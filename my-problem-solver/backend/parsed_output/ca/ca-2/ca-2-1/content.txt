2.1 Logical Operations

Binary variables (0 or 1) were first described by George Boole in 1854. He used such variables and their associated operations to describe logic in a mathematical sense. He defined a full algebra consisting of simple binary variables, along with a new set of operators, and basic operations. In the honor of George Boole, a binary variable is also known as a Boolean variable, and an algebraic system of Boolean variables is known as Boolean algebra.

Historical Note 1

George Boole(1815 – 1864) was a professor of mathematics at Queen’s college, Cork, Ireland. He proposed his theory of logic in his book – An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities. During his lifetime, the importance of his work was not recognized. It was only in 1937 that Claude Shannon observed that it is possible to describe the behavior of electronic digital circuits using Boole’s system.
