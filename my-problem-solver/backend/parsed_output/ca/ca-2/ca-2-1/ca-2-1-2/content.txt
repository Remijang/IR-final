2.1.2 Derived Operators

Two simple operators namely NAND and NOR are very useful. NAND is the logical complement of AND (truth table in Table 2.4) and NOR is the logical complement of OR (truth table in Table 2.5).

NAND and NOR are very important operators because they are known as universal operators. We can use just the NAND operator or just the NOR operator to construct any other operator. For more details the reader can refer to Kohavi and Jha [Kohavi and Jha, 2009].

Let us now define the XOR operator that stands for exclusive-or. A XOR  is equal to 1, when  , or  . The truth table is shown in Table 2.6. They symbol for XOR is  . The reader can readily verify that  by constructing truth tables.
