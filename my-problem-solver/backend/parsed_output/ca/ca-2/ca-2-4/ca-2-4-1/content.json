For example, any value representing money typically has two digits after the decimal point for most currencies in the world. In most cases, there is no reason for having more than three digits after the decimal point. Such numbers can be represented in binary easily. ",

A value such as 120.23 can be represented in binary as the binary representation of 12023. Here, the implicit assumption is that there are two digits after the decimal point. It is easy to add two numbers using this notation. It is also easy to subtract two numbers as long as the result is positive. However, multiplying or dividing such numbers is difficult. ",
