The reason for this is that $f$ is the smallest possible positive number that can be represented in our format. $g$ can thus not be represented, and most processors will round $g$ to $0$ . However, this leads to a mathematical fallacy. The IEEE 754 protocol designers thus tried to avoid situations like this by proposing the idea of denormal numbers.

Denormal numbers can thus be used as a buffer such that our normal arithmetic operations do not give unexpected results. In practice, incorporating denormal numbers in a floating point unit is difficult, and they require a lot of time to process. Consequently, a lot of small embedded processors do not support denormal numbers. However, most modern processors running on laptops and desktops have full support for denormal numbers. ",
