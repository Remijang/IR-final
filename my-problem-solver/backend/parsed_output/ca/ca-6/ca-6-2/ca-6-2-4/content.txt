6.2.4 Logical and Shift Instructions

Table 6.7 shows a list of some prominent logical and shift instructions. The primary logical instructions are and, or and xor. We can attach an ‘i’ suffix to these instructions to accept an

immediate value as the second source operand. The format is otherwise the same as the add and sub instructions.

Example 98   
Write a RISC-V assembly program to compute the bitwise OR of A and  . Let  and  .

Answer:

Akin to other ISAs, RISC-V has three shift instructions: shift left logical  , shift right logical  and shift right arithmetic (sra). They have their variants where the second source is an immediate. They are slli, srli and srai, respectively.

Example 99 Write RISC-V assembly code to compute 50/4.

Answer:

Example 100

Write RISC-V assembly code to compute  .

Answer:

addi t3 , zero , 5   
addi t2 , zero , 7   
slli t4 , t3 , 2   
add t1 , t2 , t4   
# t3 = 5   
# t2 = 7   
# t4 = t3 \* 4   
# t1 = t2 + t3 \* 4
