        "text": "x86 has a large set of floating point instructions. Let us first give a historical perspective. The early 8086 processor, and many of its successors till the Intel 486 did not have a floating point unit in the processor. They used a separate co-processor chip called the x87 that provided floating point capability. However, after the release of Intel 486, the floating point unit has been an integral part of the x86 architecture. Hence, many features of the floating point ISA are artifacts of the older era, in which a floating point instruction was essentially a message to an external processing unit. ",

        "text": "One of the direct consequences of such a design strategy is that there are no direct communication paths between integer registers, and floating point registers. Secondly, it is not possible to load an immediate into a floating point register by specifying its value in an instruction. We can load values into floating point registers only via memory. For example, if we wish to store a floating point constant in a floating point register, then we need to first load the constant in memory. Subsequently, we need to issue a floating point load instruction to load the constant into a floating point register. Figure 5.3 shows a conceptual organization of the x86 ISA. The integer instructions use the integer registers, and they have their own processor state. Likewise, the floating point instructions use their set of registers, and have their own state. Both the types of instructions, however, share the memory. ",
