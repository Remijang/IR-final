4.3 Advanced Features

We are at a good point to take a look at some advanced features in the ARM instruction set. Up till now, we have taken a look at basic instructions that allow us to implement simple data types in a high level language such as C or Java. We can translate simple programs that contain integers into assembly code, compute the results of mathematical functions, load and store values from memory. However, there are other high level features such as functions, arrays, and structures that are present in high level languages. They shall require special support at the assembly level for creating efficient implementations.

By no means has the process of programming language development stopped. We expect that over the next few decades, there will be many new kinds of programming languages. They will make the process of programming easier for more programmers, and it should be easier to leverage novel features of futuristic hardware. This would require extra instructions and support at the level of assembly programs. This is thus an evolving field, and deserves a thorough study.
