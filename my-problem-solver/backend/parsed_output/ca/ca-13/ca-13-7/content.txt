13.7 Case Studies – I/O Protocols

In this section, we shall describe the operation of several state-of-the-art I/O protocols. We shall provide a brief overview of each of these protocols in this book. For a detailed study, or wherever there is a doubt, the reader should take a look at their formal specifications posted on the web. The formal specifications are typically released by a consortium of companies that support the I/O protocol. Most of the material that we present is sourced from these specifications.
