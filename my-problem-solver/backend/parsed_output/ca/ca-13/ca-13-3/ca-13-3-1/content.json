We know that data is sent at the negative edge of a clock, and in less than a cycle it reaches the receiver. The most important issue that we need to avoid is metastability (see Section 7.3.8). A flip flop enters a metastable state when the data makes a transition within a small window of time around the negative edge of the clock. In specific, we want the data to be stable for an interval known as the setup time before the clock edge, and the data needs to be stable for another interval known as the hold time after the clock edge. The interval consisting of the setup and hold intervals, is known as the keep-out region of the clock as defined in Section 7.3.8 and [Dally and Poulton, 1998]. ",

To create a tunable delay element, we can tap the signals after every pair of inverters.

We then periodically toggle the strobe pulse once every $n$ cycles. In this case, the receiver uses a tunable delay element. It tunes its delay based on the interval between the time at which it receives the strobe pulse, and the clock transition. After sending the strobe pulse for a few cycles, we start transmitting data. Since the clocks can drift, we need to readjust or retune the delay element. Hence, it is necessary to periodically send strobe pulses to the receiver.

Since the sender and receiver clock periods are not exactly the same, there can be an issue of rate mismatch. It is possible that we might get two valid data bits in one receiver clock cycle, or get no bits at all. This will happen, when a bit arrives towards the beginning or end of a clock cycle.
