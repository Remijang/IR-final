3.3 SimpleRisc

In this book, we shall introduce a simple, generic, complete and concise RISC ISA called SimpleRisc . The assembly language of SimpleRisc has just 21 instructions, and captures most of the features of full scale assembly languages. We will use SimpleRisc to demonstrate the flavor of different types of assembly programs, and also design a processor for the SimpleRisc ISA in Chapter 9. We shall assume that SimpleRisc assembly follows the GNU assembly format, and we shall only describe the text section in this book.

Before proceeding further, let us take a tour of different instruction sets, and take a look at their properties.
