3.3.5 Logical Instructions

SimpleRisc has three logical instructions â€“ and, or, and not. and and or are 3-address instructions. They compute the bitwise AND and OR of two values, respectively. The not instruction is a 2-address instruction that computes the bitwise complement of a value. Note that the source operand of the not instruction can be an immediate or a register. Refer to Table 3.4.
