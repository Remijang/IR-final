3.3.12 The nop Instruction

Let us now add an instruction called nop that does nothing. Unlike other instructions, we do not need a table explaining the semantics of the instruction, because it does absolutely nothing!!!

Question 4 Why on earth would we add an instruction that does not do anything?

We will justify the need to have a nop instruction in our portfolio of instructions in Chapter 10. We shall see that it is important to have an instruction that does not do anything to ensure correctness in execution. Let us for the time being bear with this extra instruction that does not seem to have any purpose. The reader will definitely appreciate the need for this instruction in Chapter 10, when we discuss pipelining.
