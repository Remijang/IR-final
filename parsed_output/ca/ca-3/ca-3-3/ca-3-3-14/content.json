We can assume that the 27 bits specify an offset (both positive and negative) with respect to the current PC. The branch statements in modern programs are generated because of for/while loops or if-statements. For these constructs the branch target is typically within a range of several hundred instructions. If we have 27 bits to specify the offset, and we assume that it is a 2\u2019s complement number, then the maximum offset in any direction (positive or negative) is $2 ^ { 2 6 }$ .

        "text": "1. The first step in designing an ISA is to study the workload that the ISA is being designed for. In the case of SimpleRisc , we wanted to use it for running general purpose programs. This meant that SimpleRisc needed to be simple, concise, generic, and complete as outlined in Chapter 1. However, for different target workloads, the requirements might be very different.   \n2. After studying the workload, we need to next decide on the number of instructions that we need to have. Unless there are compelling requirements otherwise, it is not advisable to have more than 64-128 instructions. More than 128 instructions will make the instruction decoder very complex. It will also complicate the design of the processor.   \n3. After finalizing the number of instructions, we need to finalize the different types of instructions. If we are designing an ISA for extensive numerical computation, then we should have many arithmetic operations. If we are designing an ISA for processing text, then we should have many instructions that can process strings (pieces of text). In the case of SimpleRisc we devoted 6 instructions to arithmetic operations, 3 instructions to shift operations, 3 instructions to logical operations, 3 instructions to data transfer, 5 instructions to branch operations, and designated 1 instruction as no-op (no operation). We chose this distribution because we expect to run a lot of general purpose programs that will have complex arithmetical and logical constructs. We could have very well gotten rid of an instruction such as mod and replaced it with a sophisticated branch instruction, if we wanted to look at programs that will have a lot of branches. These subtle trade-offs need to be evaluated thoroughly. ",

In this case also, we want to make the common case fast. For example, there is no point in having a division instruction in programs that do not have divisions operations. Secondly, we need to decide the format of each instruction in terms of the number and type of operands. For example, in SimpleRisc , all our arithmetic operations are in the 3-address format. If there is a requirement from the side of processor designers that they want to reduce the number of registers, then we can opt for the 2-address format. Alternatively, if we want to process a massive amount of information in one go such as add a list of 10 numbers, then we can even have an 11-address format instruction. ",

For example, if we allow the register-indirect addressing mode in arithmetic instructions, then we need to add additional hardware to access the memory and fetch the operand values. On the other hand, if we have a register-only addressing mode for arithmetic instructions, then their implementation will be fast. However, the flip side is that we will need more registers, and more dedicated load-store instructions to access memory. This tradeoff needs to be kept in mind. ",
