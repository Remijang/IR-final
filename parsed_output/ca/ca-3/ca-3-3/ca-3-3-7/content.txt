3.3.7 Data Transfer Instructions: ld and st

SimpleRisc has two data transfer instructions â€“  and  . The load instruction loads values from memory into registers, and the store instruction saves values in registers to memory locations. Examples and semantics are shown in Table 3.6.

Let us consider the load instruction:  . Here, we are computing the memory address as the sum of the contents of  and the number 12. The  instructions accesses this memory address, fetches the stored integer and stores it in  . We assume that the computed memory address points to the first stored byte of the integer. Since we assume a little endian representation, the memory address contains the LSB. The details are shown in Figure 3.7(a).

The store operation does the reverse. It stores the value of  into the memory address (r2  . Refer to Figure 3.7(b).
