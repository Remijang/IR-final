Assembly language is a vital tool for writing efficient programs, and for designing the core routines of operating systems, and device drivers.   \n5.

Studying a real language in all its glory will help the reader deepen her knowledge, and she can appreciate all the tricks that are required to make an ISA expressive. ",
