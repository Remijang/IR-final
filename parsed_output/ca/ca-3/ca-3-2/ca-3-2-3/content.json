Different assemblers can use different syntax, even though they might agree on the basic instructions, and their operand formats. In this chapter, we explain the syntax of the GNU family of assembly languages. They are designed for the GNU assembler, which is a part of the GNU compiler collection (gcc). Like all GNU software, this assembler and the associated compiler is freely available for most platforms. As of 2012, the assembler is available at [gnu.org, ]. In this section, we shall provide a brief overview of the format of assembly files. For additional details refer to the official manual of the GNU assembler [Elsner and Fenlason, 1994]. Note that other assemblers such as NASM, and MASM, have their own formats. However, the overall structure is not conceptually very different from what we shall describe in this section. ",

        "text": "The generated assembly file will be named test.s. GNU assembly files have a very simple structure, as shown in Figure 3.4. They contain a list of sections. Examples of different sections are text (actual program), data (data with initialized values), and bss (common data that is initialized to 0). Each section starts with a section heading, which is the name of the section prefixed by the \u2018.\u2019 symbol. For example, the text section starts with the line \u201c.text\u201d. Thereafter, there is a list of assembly language statements. Each statement is typically terminated by the newline character. Likewise, the data section contains a list of data values. An assembly file begins with the file section that contains a line of the form \u2013 \u201c.file <name of the file> \u201d. When we are generating an assembly file from a C program using the gcc compiler, the name of the file in the .file section is typically the same as our original C program (test.c). The text section is mandatory, and the rest of the sections are optional. There might be one or more data sections. It is also possible to define new sections using the .section directive. In this book, we primarily concentrate on the text section because we are interested in learning about the nature of the instruction set. Let us now look at the format of assembly statements. ",
