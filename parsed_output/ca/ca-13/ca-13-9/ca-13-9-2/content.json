        "text": "For the latest designs of motherboards, and chipsets, the most accurate and up-to-date source of information is the vendor\u2019s website. Most vendors such as Intel and AMD post the details and configurations of their motherboards and chipsets after they are released. However, they typically do not post a lot of details about the architecture of the chips. The reader can refer to research papers for the architectural details of the AMD Opteron North Bridge chip [Conway and Hughes, 2007], Intel Blackford North Bridge chip [Radhakrishnan et al., 2007], and AMD North Bridge chip [Owen and Steinman, 2008] for the Griffin processor family. The book by Dally and Poulton [Dally and Poulton, 1998] is one of the best sources for information on the physical layer, and is a source of a lot of information presented in this book. Other books on digital communication [Proakis and Salehi, 2007, Sklar, 2001] are also excellent resources for further reading. Error control codes are mostly taught in courses on coding and information theory. Hence, for a deeper understanding of error control codes, the reader is referred to [Ling and Xing, 2004, Cover and Thomas, 2013]. For a detailed description of the Intel\u2019s I/O architecture and I/O ports, we shall point the reader to Intel\u2019s software developer manuals at [int, ]. The best sources for the I/O protocols are their official specifications \u2013 PCI Express [pci, ], SATA [sat, ], SCSI and SAS [scs, ], USB [usb, ], and FireWire [fir, ]. The book on memory systems by Jacob, Ng, and Wang [Jacob et al., 2007] is one of the best resources for additional information on hard disks, and DRAM memories. They explain the structure of a hard disk, and its internals in great detail. The official standards for compact discs are documented in the rainbow books. Each book in this collection contains the specifications of a certain type of optical disc. One of the earliest and most influential books in this collection is the Red Book [red, ] that contains the specifications for audio CDs. The latest DVD standards are available from http://www.dvdforum.org, and the latest Blu-Ray standards are available at the official website of the Blu-Ray Disc Association (http://www.blu-raydisc.com/en).
