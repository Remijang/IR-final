The component that requires the maximum amount of bandwidth is the display device (monitor, projector, TV). It is attached to a graphics card. The graphics card contains the graphics processor that processes image and video data. ",

A card is a printed circuit board(PCB), which can be attached to the $\\mathrm { I } / \\mathrm { O }$ system of a computer to implement a specific functionality. For example, a graphics card helps us process images and videos, a sound card helps us process high definition audio, and a network card helps us connect to the network. The picture of a network card is shown in Figure 13.3. We can see a set of chips interconnected on a printed circuit board. There are a set of ports that are used to connect external devices to the card. ",
