        "text": "Here, we take advantage of a run of 1s and 0s. For transmitting a logical 1, we set the voltage of the link equal to high. Similarly, for transmitting a logical 0, we set the voltage of the link to low. Let us now consider a run of two 1 bits. For the second bit, we do not induce any transitions in the link, and we maintain the voltage of the link as high. Similarly, if we have a run of $n$ 0s. Then for the last $( n - 1 )$ 0s we maintain the low voltage of the link, and thus we do not have transitions. Figure 13.11 shows an example. We observe that we have minimized the number of transitions by completely avoiding voltage transitions when the value of the logical bit that needs to be transmitted remains the same. This protocol is fast because we are not wasting any time (such as the RZ protocols), and is power efficient because we eliminate transitions for a run of the same bit (unlike RZ and Manchester codes).

In this case, we will have a transition only for the first and last bit. Since the receiver does not have the clock of the sender, it has no way of knowing the length of a bit period. Even if the sender and receiver share the same clock, due to delays induced in the link, the receiver might conclude that we have a run of 99 or 101 bits with a non-zero probability. Hence, we have to send additional synchronization information such that the receiver can properly read all the data that is being sent on the link. ",
