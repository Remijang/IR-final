        "text": "FireWire started out with being a high speed serial bus in Apple computers. However, nowadays, it is being perceived as a competitor to USB. Even though it is not as popular as USB, it is still commonly used. Most laptops have FireWire ports. The FireWire ports are primarily used for connecting video cameras, and high speed optical drives. FireWire is now an IEEE standard (IEEE 1394), and its specifications are thus open and standardized. Let us take a brief look at the FireWire protocol. ",

        "text": "Like all the buses that we have studied, FireWire is a high speed serial bus. For the same generation, FireWire is typically faster than USB. For example, FireWire (S800) by default has a bandwidth of 100 MB/s, as compared to 60 MB/s for high speed USB devices. Secondly, the FireWire bus was designed to be a hybrid of a peripheral bus and a computer network. A single FireWire bus can support up to 63 devices. It is possible to construct a tree of devices by interconnecting multiple FireWire buses using FireWire bridges. ",

        "text": "The most interesting thing about the FireWire protocol is that it does not presume a connection to a computer. Peripherals can communicate among themselves. For example, a printer can talk to a scanner without going through the computer. It implements a real network in the true sense. Consequently, whenever a FireWire network boots up, all the nodes co-operate and elect a leader. The leader node, or the root node is the root of a tree. Subsequently, the root node sends out messages, and each node is aware of its position in the tree. ",

Note that latest versions of the Firewall protocol that have bandwidths greater than 100 MB/s also support full duplex transmission. They however, have a different connector that requires more pins. For encoding logical bits, most FireWire buses use a method of encoding known as data strobe (DS) encoding. The DS encoding has two lines. One line contains the data (NRZ encoding), and the other line contains the strobe. The strobe is equal to the data XORed with the clock. Let the data signal be $D$ (sequence of 0s and 1s), the strobe signal be $S$ , and the clock of the sender be $C$ . We have: ",

We divide time into 125 \u00b5s cycles. The root node broadcasts a start packet to all the nodes. Nodes that wish to transmit isochronous data (data at a constant bandwidth) send their requests along with bandwidth requirements to the root node. The root node typically uses FIFO scheduling. It gives one device permission to use the bus and transmit data for a portion of the 125 \u00b5s cycle. Once the request is over, it gives permission to the next isochronous request and so on. Note that in a given cycle, we can only allot 80% of the time for isochronous transmission. Once, all the requests are over, or we complete 80% of the cycle, all isochronous transactions stop. The root subsequently considers asynchronous requests (single message transfers). ",

Once a request reaches the root node, it sends a packet back to the requester to grant it permission to transmit a packet. The receiver is supposed to acknowledge the receipt of the packet. After a packet transmission has finished, the root node schedules the next request. The aspect of denying requests made by downstream nodes is similar to the concept of a daisy chain (see Section 13.4.3). ",
