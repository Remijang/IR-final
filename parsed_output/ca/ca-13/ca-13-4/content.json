        "text": "Now, we are ready to discuss the data link layer. The data link layer gets sequences of logical bits from the physical layer. If the width of the serial in \u2013 parallel out register is $n$ bits, then we are guaranteed to get $n$ bits at one go. The job of the data link layer is to break the data into frames, and buffer frames for transmission on other outgoing links. Secondly, it performs rudimentary error checking and correction. It is possible that due to electromagnetic interference, errors might be induced in the signal. For example, a logical 1 might flip to a logical 0, and vice versa. It is possible to correct such single bit errors in the data link layer. If there are a lot of errors, and it is not possible to correct the errors, then at this stage, the receiver can send a message to the transmitter requesting for a retransmission. After error checking the frame is ready to be forwarded on another link if required. ",

In this case, we need to arbitrate between the requests, and ensure that only one sender can send data at any single point of time. This process is known as arbitration, and is also typically performed in the data link layer. Lastly, the arbitration logic needs to have special support for handling requests that are part of a transaction. For example, the bus to the memory units might contain a load request as a part of a memory transaction. In response, the memory unit sends a response message containing the contents of the memory locations. We need a little bit of additional support at the level of the bus controller to support such message patterns. ",
