7.3.4 Edge Sensitive SR Flip-flop

Figure 7.19 shows a clocked edge sensitive SR flip-flop. We connect two clocked SR flip-flops together. The only difference is that the second SR flip-flop uses the complement of the clock signal,  . The first flip-flop is known as the master, and the second flip-flop is known as the slave. This flip-flop is also known as a master-slave SR flip-flop. Here, is how this circuit works.

Definition 51

A master-slave flip-flop contains two flip-flops that are connected to each other. The master’s output is the slave’s input. Typically, the slave uses a clock signal that is the logical complement of the master’s clock.

Whenever the clock signal is high (1), the inputs (S and R) are read into the first SR flipflop. When the clock signal becomes low (0), then the first flip-flop stops accepting new data; however, the second flip-flop takes the output of the first flip-flop and sets its output accordingly. Thus, new data arrives at the output terminals Q and  when the clock transitions from 1 to 0 (downward clock edge). We thus have created a flip-flop that is edge sensitive.

However, some problems still remain. If both S and R are 1, then there might be a race condition, and the output can be unpredictable. This problem needs to be fixed. Let us first try to look at a complex solution that augments the clocked edge sensitive SR flip-flop, and then look at simpler solutions.
