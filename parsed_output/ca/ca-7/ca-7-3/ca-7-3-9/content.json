Such an $n$ bit structure is known as an $n$ bit register. Here, we can load $n$ bits in parallel, and also read out $n$ bits in parallel at every negative clock edge. Hence, this structure is known as a parallel in\u2013parallel out register. Its structure is shown in Figure 7.24. ",

        "text": "Let us now consider a serial in\u2013parallel out register as shown in Figure 7.25. Here, we have a single input that is fed into the leftmost D flip flop. Every cycle, the input moves to the adjacent flip flop on the right. Thus, to load $n$ bits it will take $n$ cycles. The first bit will get loaded into the leftmost flip flop in the first cycle, and it will take $n$ cycles for it to reach the last flip flop. By that time, the rest of the $n - 1$ flip flops will get loaded with the rest of the $n - 1$ bits. We can then read out all the $n$ bits in parallel (similar to the parallel in\u2013parallel out register). This register is also known as a shift register and is used for implementing circuits used in high speed I/O buses. ",
