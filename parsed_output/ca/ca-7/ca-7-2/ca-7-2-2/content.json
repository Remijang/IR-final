Let us thus treat the input as a Boolean representation of one of the outputs $( 0 \\ldots ( n - 1 ) )$ ). For example, if the value of the $l o g ( n )$ -bit input is equal to $i$ , then the $i ^ { t h }$ output is set to $1$ . The rest of the outputs are set to 0.

The reader can verify that this is indeed happening (note that we are counting from 0). The AND gate corresponding to the $2 ^ { n d }$ output needs to compute $\\overline { { A } } B$ .
