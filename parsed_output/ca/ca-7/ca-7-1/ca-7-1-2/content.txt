7.1.2 P-N Junction

Let us consider a p-n junction as shown in Figure 7.2. The p-type region has an excess of holes and the n-type region has an excess of electrons. At the junction, some holes cross over and move to the  region because they are attracted by electrons. Similarly, some electrons cross over and get amassed on the side of the  region. This migration of holes and electrons is known as diffusion. The area around the junction that witnesses this migration is known as the depletion region. However, due to the migration of electrons and holes, an electric field is produced in the opposite direction of migration in the depletion region. This electric field induces a current known as the drift current. At steady state, the drift and diffusion currents balance each other, and thus there is effectively no current flow across the junction.

Now, let us see what will happen if we connect both sides of the p-n junction to a voltage source such as a battery. If we connect the  side to the positive terminal, and the n side to the negative terminal, then this configuration is known as forward bias. In this case, holes flow from the p side of the junction to the n side, and electrons flow in the reverse direction. The junction thus conducts current.

If we connect the p side to the negative terminal and the n side to the positive terminal, then this configuration is known as reverse bias. In this case, holes and electrons are pulled away from the junction. Thus, there is no current flow across the junction and the p-n junction in this case does not conduct electricity.

A simple p-n junction as described is known as a diode. It conducts current in only one direction, i.e., when it is in forward bias.

Definition 46   
A diode is an electronic device typically made of a single p-n junction that conducts current in only one direction.
