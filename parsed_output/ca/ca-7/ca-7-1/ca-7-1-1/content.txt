7.1.1 Doping

Typically, two types of impurities are added to silicon to modify its properties:  -type and  - type. N-type impurities typically consist of group V elements in the periodic table. Phosphorus is the most common n-type dopant. Arsenic is also occasionally used. The effect of adding a group V dopant with five valence electrons is that an extra electron gets detached from the lattice, and is available for conducting current. This process of doping effectively increases the conductivity of silicon.

Likewise, it is possible to add a group III element such as boron or gallium to silicon to create p-type doped silicon. This produces the reverse effect. It creates a void in the lattice. This void is also referred to as a hole. A hole denotes the absence of an electron. Like electrons, holes are free to move. Holes can also help in conducting current. Electrons have a negative charge, and holes are conceptually associated with a positive charge.

Now that we have created two kinds of semiconductor materials – n-type and p-type. Let us see what happens if we connect them to form a p-n junction.

Definition 45

• An n-type semiconductor has group V impurities such as phosphorus and arsenic. Its primary charge carriers are electrons.   
A p-type semiconductor has group III impurities such as boron and gallium. Its primary charge carriers are holes. Holes have an effective positive charge.   
• A p-n junction is formed when we place a p-type and n-type semiconductor side by side.
