7.1 Silicon-Based Transistors

Silicon is the  element in the periodic table. It has four valence electrons and belongs to the same group as carbon and germanium. However, it is less reactive than both.

Over 90% of the earthâ€™s crust consists of silicon-based minerals. Silicon dioxide is the primary constituent of sand, and quartz. It is abundantly available, and is fairly inexpensive to manufacture.

Silicon has some interesting properties that make it the ideal substrate for designing circuits and processors. Let us consider the molecular structure of silicon. It has a dense structure, where each silicon atom is connected to four other silicon atoms, and the tightly connected set of silicon atoms are bound together to form a strong lattice. Other materials notably, diamond, have a similar crystalline structure. Silicon atoms are thus more tightly packed than most metals.

Due to the paucity of free electrons, silicon does not have very good electrical conduction properties. In fact, it is midway between a good conductor, and an insulator. It is thus known as a semiconductor. It is possible to slightly modify its properties by adding some impurities in a controlled manner. This process is called doping.

A semiconductor has an electrical conductivity, which is midway between a good conductor and an insulator.
