It has a dense structure, where each silicon atom is connected to four other silicon atoms, and the tightly connected set of silicon atoms are bound together to form a strong lattice. Other materials notably, diamond, have a similar crystalline structure. Silicon atoms are thus more tightly packed than most metals. ",
