        "text": "It turns out that we can make a combinational logic circuit out of a memory cell similar to a PROM cell very easily. Such devices are known as programmable logic arrays, or PLAs. PLAs are used to implement complex logic functions consisting of tens or hundreds of minterms in practice. The advantage of a PLA over a hardwired circuit made up of logic gates is that a PLA is flexible. We can change the Boolean logic implemented by the PLA at run time. In comparison, a circuit made in silicon can never change its logic. Secondly, designing and programming a PLA is simpler, and there are a lot of software tools to design and work with PLAs. Lastly, a PLA can have multiple outputs, and it can thus implement multiple Boolean functions very easily. This additional flexibility comes at a cost, and the cost is performance. ",

As a result of this, the voltage difference between the source and drain terminals of the NMOS transistor is very small. In other words, we can simplistically assume that the voltage of the result line is equal to the voltage of the signal, $X$ . If ( $E = 0$ ), the NMOS transistor is in the OFF state. The result line is floating, and it maintains its precharged voltage. In this case, we propose to infer a logical 1. ",

The gates of the transistors of the PLA cells are connected to a set of enable signals, $E _ { 1 } \\ldots E _ { n }$ .

We assume that we precharge the result line to a voltage corresponding to logical 1 at the beginning. Now, if none of the input voltages is equal to 0, then the value of the result line will be equal to a logical 1. We can thus conclude that the Boolean function computed by a row of PLA cells is equal to $X _ { 1 } . X _ { 2 } \\ldots X _ { n }$ (assuming that all the cells are enabled). For example, if we want to compute the value of the minterm, $A B C D$ , then we need to set $X _ { 1 } = A$ , $X _ { 2 } = B$ , $X _ { 3 } = C$ , and $X _ { 4 } = D$ .

Hence, the first row contains PLA cells in the columns corresponding to $A$ , $\\overline { B }$ , and $\\overline { { C } }$ .
