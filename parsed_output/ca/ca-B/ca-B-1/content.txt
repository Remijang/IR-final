B.1 Overview

High intensity graphics is a hallmark of contemporary computer systems. Todayâ€™s computers from smartphones to high-end desktops use a variety of sophisticated visual effects to enhance user experience. Additionally, people use computers to play graphics intensive games, watch high definition videos, and for computer aided engineering design. All of these applications require a significant amount of graphics processing.

In the early days, graphics support in computers was very rudimentary. The programmer needed to specify the co-ordinates of every single shape that was drawn on the screen. For example, to draw a line the programmer needed to explicitly provide the co-ordinates of the line, and specify its color. The range of colors was very limited, and there was almost no hardware for off loading graphics intensive tasks. Since each line or circle drawn on the screen required several assembly statements, the process of creating, and using computer graphics was very slow. Gradually, a need arose to have some support for graphics in hardware.

Let us discuss a little bit of background before delving into hardware accelerated graphics. A typical computer monitor contains a matrix of pixels. A pixel is a small point on the screen. For example a  monitor has 1920 pixels in each row, and 1080 pixels in each column. Each pixel has a color at a certain point of time. Modern computer systems can set 16 million colors for each pixel. A picture on a computer screen is essentially an array of colored pixels, and a video is essentially a sequence of pictures. In a video, we typically show 50-100 pictures every second (known as the refresh rate ), where one picture is marginally different from the previous one. The human eye cannot figure out the fact that the pictures on the computer screen are changing in rapid succession. The brain creates an illusion of a continuous animation.
