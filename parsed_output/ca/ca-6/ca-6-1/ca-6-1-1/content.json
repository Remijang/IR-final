There are a set of baseline versions (common cores). Developers build on top of a common core by adding extensions. Given that the philosophy of RISC-V is to run on all kinds of machines, the notion of having different core ISAs and extensions aligns with it well.

The \u2018E\u2019 suffix has a special place. It indicates the embedded version that uses a reduced number of registers. For example, RV32E assumes only 16 integer registers as opposed to 32 integer registers in the regular version. It is important to note that unlike other ISAs (such as ARM Thumb), the instruction sizes remain the same. This simplifies compiler and processor design. ",

Then, there are a bunch of extensions that can be added based on users\u2019 requirements. The list of extensions has become quite large as of 2024 (around 20-30). Most of the common ones correspond to floating point instructions, atomic operations, cryptographic primitives, memory barriers, etc. For example, RV32IMA means that integer instructions (I), multiplication/ division instructions (M) and atomic instructions (A) are supported.

However, we can have longer formats: 48 or 64 bits. Such instructions (at the moment) are not a part of the standard set of instructions, but there are extensions that require these longer instructions. Some of these extensions are vector instructions, bitmanipulation instructions and cryptographic extensions. The instruction format has bits to indicate if the instruction is longer than 32 bits or not.

Instead, it has a base set of instructions, a set of extensions, 48 and 64-bit instruction lengths (may get fully frozen in the future) and different ISA variants including a compressed 16-bit form. This sounds more like \u201cCISC\u201d. However, there is still a lot of regularity in the ISA: there are a few instructions formats, instructions are mostly 32 bits in length and the base ISA is very \u201cRISC like\u201d. Such trade-offs are inevitable in designing any modern ISA that needs to support a wide range of devices: embedded processors to supercomputers. ",
