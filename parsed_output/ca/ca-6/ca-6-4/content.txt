6.4 Floating Point Instructions

Let us now look at the floating point instructions in RISC-V. In 2017, the ‘F’ and ‘D’ extensions were introduced for single precision and double precision floating point operations, respectively. This part of the instruction set is quite conventional and is similar to other RISC ISAs. Floating point numbers are stored in the regular IEEE 754 format.
