Given that this bit is fixed, there is no need to represent it. In other words the $0 ^ { t h }$ bit is set to 0 and thus need not be represented. The format thus stores the rest of the 4 bits in the first 5-bit field. Note that as compared to the S format, the immediate bits 4..1 are stored in exactly the same positions. This makes extracting these bits very easy and there is consequently no need to design additional decoder hardware to handle these bits differently in the B format. Given that the $0 ^ { t h }$ bit is not stored, its corresponding position can be used to store the $1 1 ^ { t h }$ bit. ",

This format can thus encode an offset between -4096 and 4095 ( $\\approx \\pm 4$ KB). This offset is sign-extended and added to the PC. ",

The immediate here encodes an offset that is a multiple of 2 (akin to the B format). There is no need to store the LSB, which is set to 0. Like the B format, there is a need to store 20 bits. The order of storing the bits from the most significant position to the least significant position is as follows: bit 20, bits 10..1, bit 11, bits 19..12. Given that we encode 21 bits in this format (20 explicitly and 1 implicitly), we can represent an offset range that is within $\\pm 1 M B$ of the current PC. ",
