Case Studies of Real Processors

Let us now look at the design of some real processors such that we can understand all the concepts that we have learned up till now from a practical perspective. We shall study embedded (for smaller mobile devices), and server processors of three major processor companies namely ARM, AMD, and Intel. Let us start with a disclaimer. The aim of this section is not to compare and contrast the design of processors across the three companies, or even between different models of the same company. Every processor is designed optimally for a certain market segment with certain key business decisions in mind. Hence, our focus in this section would be to study the designs from a technical perspective, and appreciate the nuances of the design.
