In Line 9, we load a set of four floating point numbers into the 128-bit vector variable, val1. val1 is mapped to a vector register by the compiler. We use the function mm load ps to load a set of 4 contiguous floating point values from memory. For example, the function $\\_ m m \\_ l o a d \\_ p s ( a )$ loads four floating point values in the locations, $a$ , $a + 4$ , $a + 8$ , and $a + 1 2$ into a vector register. Similarly, we load the second vector register, val2, with four floating point values starting from the memory address, $b$ . In Line 13, we perform the vector addition, and save the result in a 128- bit vector register associated with the variable res. We use the intrinsic function, mm add ps, for this purpose. In Line 16, we store the variable, $r e s$ , in the memory locations namely $c$ , $c + 4$ , $c + 8$ , and $c + 1 2$ . ",

We compared the performance of this function, with a version of the function that does not use vector instructions on a quad core Intel Core i7 machine. The code with SSE instructions ran 2-3 times faster for million-element arrays. If we had wider SSE registers, then we could have gained more speedups. The latest AVX vector ISA on x86 processors supports 256 and 512-bit vector registers. Interested readers can implement the function shown in Example 155 using the AVX vector ISA, and compare the performance. ",
