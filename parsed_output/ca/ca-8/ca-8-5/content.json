We load the significand of $B$ into register $W$ . In this case, the width of $W$ is equal to double the size of the operands such that the product can be accommodated. The $E$ register is initialized to $E _ { A } + E _ { B } - b i a s$ . This is because in the case of multiplication, the exponents are added together. We subtract the bias to avoid double counting. Computing the sign of the result is trivial. ",

Both of them are $O ( l o g ( n ) )$ operations. The total time taken is thus $O ( l o g ( n ) )$ . ",
