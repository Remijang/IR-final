Hence, to avoid repetition let us just focus on the d-cache from now on. The reader needs to just remember that accesses to the instruction cache follow the same sequence of steps. ",

Given that their designs are quite similar, we subsequently don\u2019t differentiate between them. We shall use the generic term \u201cL1 cache\u201d to refer to either one of them. If there is an L1 hit, then the processor usually receives the value within 1-2 cycles. Otherwise, the request needs to go to the L2 cache (typically shared for both code and data), or possibly even lower levels such as the main memory. In this case, the request can take tens or hundreds of cycles. In this section, we shall look at the system of caches in totality, and treat them as one single black box referred to as the memory system. ",

For example, if a system has 1 GB of main memory, then the size of the memory system is equal to 1 GB. It is possible that internally, the memory system might have a hierarchy of caches for improving performance. However, they do not add to the total storage capacity, because they only contain subsets of the data contained in main memory. Moreover, the memory access logic of the processor also views the entire memory system as a single unit, conceptually modeled as a large array of bytes. This is also known as the physical memory system, or the physical address space. ",
