Note that in our 5 stage in-order pipeline the ideal instruction throughput is 1 instruction per cycle, and the memory stage is allotted 1 cycle. In practice, if a memory access takes $n$ cycles, then we have $n - 1$ stall cycles, and they need to be accounted for by Equation 11.1. In this equation, we implicitly assume that every memory access suffers a stall for $A M A T - 1$ cycles. Practically, this is not the case since most of the instructions will hit in the i-cache, and it typically has a 1-cycle latency. Hence, accesses that hit in the i-cache or d-cache will not stall. However, long stall cycles will be introduced by accesses that miss in the L1 and L2 caches. ",
