Up till now we have been loosely using the term \u2013 program \u2013 and sometimes using it in place of a process. A program is an array of bytes and is saved as a file in the file system. The file is typically known as a binary or as an executable. The executable contains some metadata about the program such that its name and type, the constants used by the program, and the set of instructions. In comparison, a process is a running instance of a program. If we run one program several times, we create multiple processes. A process has access to the processor, peripheral devices, and the memory system. There is a dedicated area in the memory system that contains the data and code of the process. The program counter of the processor points to a location in the code region of the process in memory. Memory values required by the process are obtained from its data region in the memory system. Finally, note that the operating system starts and ends a process, and manages it throughout its lifetime. ",

Notably, it copies all the instructions in the text section, allocates space for all the data, and initializes memory with all the constants that a program will require during its execution. Subsequently, it initializes the values of registers, copies command line arguments to the stack, possibly initializes the stack pointer, and jumps to the entry point of the program. The user program can then begin to execute, in the context of a running process. Every process has a unique number associated with it. It is known as the pid (process id).

However, behind the scenes, the kernel is busy at work. For example, it might be running a game for some time, running a program to fetch data from the network for some time, and then running some of its own tasks for some time. The kernel also manages aspects of the file system, inter-process communication, and security. The discussion of such topics is beyond the scope of this book.

Subsequently, the header contains the details of each section in the memory map.

The text section starts after the header. The operating system sets the program counter to the start of the text section while loading a program.

Let us assume that program $A$ runs and writes its values in the bss section. Subsequently, program $B$ runs. Before, writing to a variable in the bss section, $B$ can always try to read its value. In this case, it will get the value written by program $A$ . However, this is not a desirable behavior.

However, data in the heap stays for the entire life of the program. It can be used by all the functions in the program, and pointers to different data structures in the heap can be shared across functions. Note that the heap grows upward (towards higher addresses). Secondly, managing the memory in a heap is a fairly difficult task. This is because dynamically, regions of the heap are allocated with malloc/new calls and freed with the free/delete calls in high level languages. Once an allocated memory region is freed, a hole gets created in the memory map. It is possible to allocate some other data structure in the hole if its size is less than the size of the hole. In this case, another smaller hole gets created in the memory map. Over time as more and more data structures are allocated and deallocated, the number of holes tend to increase. This is known as fragmentation. Hence, it is necessary to have an efficient memory manager that can reduce the number of holes in the heap.
