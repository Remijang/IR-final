We need to first take a look at all the ways of the set that a given block is mapped to, and see if there are any empty entries. If there are empty entries then we can choose one of the entries arbitrarily, and populate it with the contents of the given block. If we do not find any empty entries, we need to invoke the replace and evict operations to choose and remove an already existing block from the set. ",
