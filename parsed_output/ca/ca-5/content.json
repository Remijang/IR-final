They are primarily used in Intel and AMD processors, which have an overwhelmingly large market share in the desktop, laptop, and low-end server markets. They are steadily making deep inroads into the middle and high-end server markets as well as the smartphone market. Hence, it is essential for the reader to have a good understanding of this important class of assembly languages.
