5.5 Encoding the x86 ISA

We have taken a look at a wide variety of x86 instructions, addressing modes, and instruction formats. It is truly a CISC instruction set. However, the process of encoding is more regular. Almost all the instructions follow a standard format. In the case of ARM and SimpleRisc , we described the process of encoding instructions in great detail. We shall refrain from doing this here for the sake of brevity. Secondly, an opcode in x86 typically has a variety of modes, and prefixes. We do not want to digress from the main theme of this book by describing x86 in such level of detail. Let us start out by looking at the broad structure of an encoded machine instruction.
