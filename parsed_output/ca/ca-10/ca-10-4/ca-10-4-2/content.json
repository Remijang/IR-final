We have added an arrow between the relevant pipeline stages of both the instructions to indicate that there is a dependency. Since the arrow is towards the left (backwards in time), we cannot execute this code sequence in a pipeline. This is known as a data hazard. A hazard is defined as the possibility of erroneous execution of an instruction in a pipeline. This specific case is classified as a data hazard, where it is possible that instruction 2 might get the wrong data unless adequate steps are taken. ",

To avoid a RAW hazard it is necessary to ensure that the pipeline is aware of the fact that it contains a pair of instructions, where one instruction writes to a register, and another instruction that comes later in program order reads from the same register. It needs to ensure that the consumer instruction correctly receives the value of the operand (in this case, register) from the producer instruction. We shall look at solutions in both hardware and software. ",
