The $M A \\to E X$ path is required for forwarding results between consecutive ALU instructions. The $R W  M A$ path is required when the value of the input is generated in the MA stage, and it is also required in the MA stage. The only instruction that generates a value in the MA stage is the load instruction, and the only instruction that requires register operands in the MA stage, is the store instruction. Thus, we need to use the $R W \\to M A$ forwarding path between a load instruction, and an immediately succeeding store instruction, when there is a register dependence. The following code snippet gives an example. ",
