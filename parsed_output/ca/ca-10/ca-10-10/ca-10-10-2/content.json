Over a sufficiently long period of time, the amount of electrical energy flowing in to the chip is exactly equal to the amount of energy dissipated as heat according to the law of conservation of energy. Note that we disregard the energy spent in sending electrical signals along I/O links. In any case, this energy is negligible as compared to the power dissipation of the entire chip. ",

The capacitor represents the equivalent capacitance of transistors in the circuit. We need to note that different parts of a circuit such as the gates of transistors have a certain potential at a given point in time. This means that the gate of a transistor is functioning as a capacitor, and hence storing charge. Similarly, the drain and source of a transistor have an equivalent drain and source capacitance. We typically do not consider equivalent inductance in a simplistic analysis, because most wires are typically short, and they do not function as inductors. ",
