For example, if a processor has 4 pipelines, then each bundle contains 4 instructions. The compilers create bundles such that there are no dependencies across instructions in a bundle. The broader aim of designing EPIC/VLIW processors is to move all the complexity to software. Compilers arrange the bundles in a way such that we can minimize the amount of interlock, forwarding, and instruction handling logic required in the processor. ",

A high performance processor still needed a fair amount of complexity in hardware, and required some sophisticated architectural features. These features increased the complexity and power consumption of hardware. ",
