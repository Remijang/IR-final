10.8.5 SimpleRisc Assembly Code of an Interrupt Handler

Let us now quickly conclude our discussion by showing the assembly code of an interrupt handler. The code for saving the context is shown in Figure 10.32, and the code for restoring the context and returning to the user program is shown in Figure 10.33. We assume that the stack pointer for the interrupt handler starts at : 0x FF FF FF FC.
