There are 12 SPECint benchmarks that are written in C/C++. The benchmarks contain parts of C compilers, gene sequencers, AI engines, discrete event simulators, and XML processors.

The recommended procedure is to take the ratio of the time taken by a benchmark on a reference processor, and the time taken by the benchmark on the given processor. The SPEC score is equal to the geometric mean of all the ratios. In computer architecture, when we report the mean relative performance (as in the case of SPEC scores), we typically use the geometric mean. For just reporting the average time of execution (absolute time), we can use the arithmetic mean. ",
