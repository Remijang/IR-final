1.8.2 Processing Information

In this part, we shall actually build a basic computer. Chapter 7 will start out with the basic building blocks of a processor – logic gates, registers, and memories. Readers who have already taken a digital design course can skip this chapter. Chapter 8 deals with computer arithmetic. It introduces detailed algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for both integers and real numbers. Most computers today perform very heavy numerical computations.

Hence, it is necessary to obtain a firm understanding of how numerical operations are actually implemented, and get an idea of the trade-offs of different designs.

After these two chapters, we would be ready to actually design a simple processor in Chapter 9. We shall assemble a simple processor part by part, and then look at two broad design styles – hardwired, and micro-programmed. Modern processors are able to process many instructions simultaneously, and have complex logic for taking the dependencies across instructions into account. The most popular technique in this area is known as pipelining. We shall discuss pipelining in detail in Chapter 10.
