Readers who have already taken a digital design course can skip this chapter. Chapter 8 deals with computer arithmetic. It introduces detailed algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for both integers and real numbers. Most computers today perform very heavy numerical computations. ",

We shall assemble a simple processor part by part, and then look at two broad design styles \u2013 hardwired, and micro-programmed. Modern processors are able to process many instructions simultaneously, and have complex logic for taking the dependencies across instructions into account. The most popular technique in this area is known as pipelining. We shall discuss pipelining in detail in Chapter 10. ",
