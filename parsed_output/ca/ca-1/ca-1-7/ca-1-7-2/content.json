        "text": "John von Neumann proposed the Von Neumann architecture for general purpose Turing complete computers. Note that there were several other scientists such as John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert who independently developed similar ideas. Eckert and Mauchly designed the first general purpose Turing complete computer(with one minor limitation) called ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) based on this architecture in 1946. It was used to compute artillery firing tables for the US army\u2019s ballistic research laboratory. This computer was later succeeded by the EDVAC computer in 1949, which was also used by the US army\u2019s ballistics research laboratory. ",

The instruction table is saved in memory. The processing engine that is akin to our modified Turing machine is called the CPU (central processing unit). It contains the program counter. Its job is to fetch new instructions, and execute them. It has dedicated functional units to calculate the results of arithmetic functions, load and store values in memory locations, and compute the results of branch instructions. Lastly, like the Harvard architecture, the CPU is connected to the I/O subsystem. ",

        "text": "The path breaking innovation in this machine was that the instruction table was stored in memory. It was possible to do so by encoding every instruction with the same set of symbols that are normally stored in memory. For example, if the memory stores decimal values, then each instruction needs to be encoded into a string of decimal digits. A Von Neumann CPU needs to decode every instruction. The crux of this idea is that instructions are treated as regular data(memory values). We shall see in later chapters that this simple idea is actually a very powerful tool in designing elegant computing systems. This idea is known as the stored program concept. ",

        "text": "The stored program concept tremendously simplifies the design of a computer. Since memory data and instructions are conceptually treated the same way, we can have one unified processing system and memory system that treats instructions and data the same way. From the point of view of the CPU, the program counter points to a generic memory location whose contents will be interpreted as that of an encoded instruction. It is easy to store, modify, and transmit programs. Programs can also dynamically change their behavior during runtime by modifying themselves and even other programs. This forms the basis of today\u2019s complex compilers that convert high level C programs into machine instructions. Furthermore, a lot of modern systems such as the Java virtual machine dynamically modify their instructions to achieve efficiency. ",

Hence, strictly speaking they are not exactly equivalent to a Turing machine. This is true for all practical machines. They need to have finite resources. Nevertheless, the scientific community has learned to live with this approximation. ",
