1.7.1 Harvard Architecture

One of the earliest efforts in this direction was the Harvard Mark-I. The Harvard architecture is very similar to our concept machine shown in Figure 1.10. Its block diagram is shown in Figure 1.11. There are separate structures for maintaining the instruction table and the memory. The former is also known as instruction memory because we can think of it as a specialized memory tailored to hold only instructions. The latter holds data values that programs need. Hence, it is known as the data memory. The engine for processing instructions is divided into two parts â€“ control and ALU. The job of the control unit is to fetch instructions, process them, and co-ordinate their execution. ALU stands for arithmetic-logic-unit. It has specialized circuits that can compute arithmetic expressions or logical expressions (AND/OR/NOT etc.).

Note that every computer needs to take inputs from the user/programmer and needs to finally communicate results back to the programmer. This can be done through a multitude of methods. Today we use a keyboard and monitor. Early computers used a set of switches and the final result was printed out on a piece of paper.
