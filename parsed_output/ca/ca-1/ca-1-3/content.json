Unlike our brains, it is not endowed with abstract thought, reason, and conscience. At least at the moment, computers cannot take very sophisticated decisions on their own. All they can do is execute a program. Nonetheless, the reason computers are so powerful is because they are extremely good at executing programs. ",

As compared to computers, our brains are creative, tire easily, and do not like to do the same thing over and over again. To combine the best of both worlds, our brains need to produce computer programs that specify the set of tasks that need to be performed in great detail. A computer can then process the program, and produce the desired output by following each instruction in the program. ",
