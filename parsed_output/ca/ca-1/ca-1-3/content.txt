1.3 Computers are Dumb Machines

Irrespective of the underlying technology, a fundamental concept that we need to understand is that a computer is fundamentally a dumb machine. Unlike our brains, it is not endowed with abstract thought, reason, and conscience. At least at the moment, computers cannot take very sophisticated decisions on their own. All they can do is execute a program. Nonetheless, the reason computers are so powerful is because they are extremely good at executing programs.

They can execute billions of basic instructions per second. This makes them dumb yet very fast. A comparison of the computer with the human brain is shown in Table 1.1.

If we combine the processing power of computers, with intelligent programs written by the human brain, we have the exquisite variety of software available today. Everything from operating systems to word processors to computer games is written this way.

The basic question that we need to answer is :

Question 2 How, do we make a dumb machine do intelligent things?

Computers are these tireless machines that can keep on doing calculations very quickly without ever complaining about the monotonicity of the work. As compared to computers, our brains are creative, tire easily, and do not like to do the same thing over and over again. To combine the best of both worlds, our brains need to produce computer programs that specify the set of tasks that need to be performed in great detail. A computer can then process the program, and produce the desired output by following each instruction in the program.

Hence, we can conclude that we should use the creative genius of our brains to write programs. Each program needs to contain a set of basic instructions that a computer can process. Henceforth, a computer can produce the desired output. An instruction is defined as a basic command that can be given to a computer.
