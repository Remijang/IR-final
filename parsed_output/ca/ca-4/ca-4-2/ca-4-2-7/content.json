Any instruction can in principle be the start of a function. In ARM assembly, the starting instruction of a function needs to have a label assigned to it. Along with branching to the given label, the $b l$ instruction also saves the value of the return address, which is equal to the current PC plus 4, into the $l r$ register ( $r$ 14).

When we wish to return from a function, we need to move the value in the lr register to the pc register ( $r$ 15).
