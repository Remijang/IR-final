However, it is possible to make any data processing instruction set the flags by adding the suffix - \u2018s\u2019 - to it. For example, the adds and subs instructions do the regular jobs of addition and subtraction, respectively, and additionally also set the CPSR flags. The rules for setting the flags are given in Section 4.2.3. Let us now see how we can use these flags. ",
