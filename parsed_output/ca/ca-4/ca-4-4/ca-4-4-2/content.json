We can either add the offset from the base register or we can subtract it from the base register. This is specified by the U bit.

Answer: Negative numbers such as -4 or -8 cannot be represented in ARM\u2019s 12-bit format for specifying offsets in memory instructions. However, we might need to use addresses with a negative displacement, especially when they are relative to the frame pointer or the stack pointer. The U bit allows us to represent an immediate such as -4 as +4. It additionally instructs the processor to subtract the displacement from the base register. ",
