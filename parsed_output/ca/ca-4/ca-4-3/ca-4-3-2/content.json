We limit our discussion to the stack. ldmfd and $s t m f d$ instructions take a base register (e.g., stack pointer), and set of registers as arguments. They load or store the set of registers in the memory region pointed to by the base register. Note that the order of the registers does not matter.

Recall that the top of the stack in a downward growing stack is defined as the starting address of the last value pushed on the stack. In this case the registers are processed in ascending order \u2013 $r 1$ , $r 2$ , $r 3$ , $r 4$ . Secondly memory addresses are also accessed in ascending order. Consequently, $r 1$ will be saved in $s p - 1 6$ , $r 2$ in $s p - 1 2$ , $r 3$ in $s p - 8$ , and $r 4$ in $s p - 4$ . Alternatively, we can explain this instruction by observing that registers are pushed into the stack in descending order. We use the \u2018!\u2019 suffix with the base address register to instruct the processor to update the value of the stack pointer after the execution of the instruction.
