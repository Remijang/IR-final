Note that the set of integers are a subset of the set of floating point numbers. An integer such as 7 can be represented as 7.0000000.

We shall further observe that representing different kinds of floating point numbers is slightly complicated, and requires us to consider many special cases. To make our life easy, let us first slightly simplify the problem and consider representing a set of numbers known as fixed point numbers. ",
