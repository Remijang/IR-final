We shall see in the rest of this book that it is very easy to store, retrieve and process billions of 0s and 1s. Secondly, existing technologies to implement computers using silicon transistors are very compatible with the notion of processing 0s and 1s. A basic silicon transistor is a switch that can set the output to a logical 0 or 1, based on the input. The silicon transistor is the basis of all the electronic computers that we have today right from processors in mobile phones to processors in supercomputers. Some early computers made in the late nineteenth century processed decimal numbers. They were mostly mechanical in nature. It looks like for the next few decades, students of computer architecture need to study the language of 0s and 1s in great detail. ",

Well it turns out that we can do everything that we could have done if our basic circuits were able to process normal decimal numbers. We can divide the set of operations into two major types \u2013 logical and arithmetic. Logical operations express concepts of the form, \u201cthe red light is on AND the yellow light is on\u201d, or \u201cthe bank account is closed if the user is inactive AND the account is a current account.\u201d Arithmetic operations refer to operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
