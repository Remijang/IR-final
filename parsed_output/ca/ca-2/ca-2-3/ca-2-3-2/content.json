Moreover, let the rest of the $( n - 1 )$ bits represent the number\u2019s magnitude. For a negative number, $- \\mathrm { u } ( u \\geq 0 )$ , let us simply flip all the bits of $+ \\mathrm { u }$ . If a bit is 0, we replace it by 1, and vice versa. Note that this operation flips the sign bit also, effectively negating the number. The number system can represent numbers between $\\pm ( 2 ^ { n - 1 } - 1 )$ like the sign-magnitude system. ",

If we add one to zero, the result should be one. However, in this case, it is still zero! This means that we need to make the process of addition more sophisticated. This will slow down the process of addition and make it more complex. ",
