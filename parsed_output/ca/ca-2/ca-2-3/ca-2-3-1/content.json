Let us consider an $n$ -bit integer. We can use the MSB as the designated signed bit, and use the rest of the number to represent the number\u2019s magnitude. The magnitude of a number is represented using $n - 1$ bits. This is a simple and intuitive representation. In this representation, the range of the magnitude of an $n$ -bit integer is from 0 till $2 ^ { n - 1 } - 1$ . Hence, the number system has a range equal to $\\pm ( 2 ^ { n - 1 } - 1 )$ . Note that there are two zeros \u2013 a positive zero $( 0 0 \\ldots 0 )$ and a negative zero $( 1 0 \\ldots 0 )$ . ",
