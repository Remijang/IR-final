2.1.5 Logic Gates

Let us now try to implement circuits to realize complex Boolean formulae. We will discuss more about this in Chapter 7. We shall just provide a conceptual treatment in this section. Let us define the term “logic gate” as a device that implements a Boolean function. It can be constructed from silicon, vacuum tubes, or any other material.

Definition 16

 logic gate is a device that implements a Boolean function.

Given a set of logic gates, we can design a circuit to implement any Boolean function. The symbols for different logic gates are shown in Figure 2.1.
