Along with all the units that we just described, we have added an extra unit, which is the microprogrammed control unit ( $\\mu$ control unit). Its role is to execute a set of microinstructions corresponding to each program instruction, and orchestrate the flow of data values across the different units in the data path of the microprogrammed processor. It is mainly responsible for the execution of microinstructions, data transfers across the different units, and for transferring control to the correct program instruction by updating the PC. Note that we have also added an extra connection between the ir register and the $\\mu$ control unit to transfer the opcode of the instruction. We require the $\\mu$ control unit to load the appropriate set of microinstructions corresponding to the program instruction. By design, we do not wish to make the value of the opcode available to other units. This is because, we have a set of microinstructions for each opcode, and there is no reason why other units should require the value of the opcode. ",
