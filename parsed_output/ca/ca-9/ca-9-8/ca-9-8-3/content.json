Horizontal microprogramming eliminates the need for dedicated signal generation logic in the \u00b5control unit.   \n3. To program a horizontally microprogrammed processor, it is necessary to expose the control signals to the programmer and the microassembler. This makes the microassembler very specific to a given processor. However, in vertical microprogramming, as long as the internal register set remains the same, we do not need different microassemblers. ",
