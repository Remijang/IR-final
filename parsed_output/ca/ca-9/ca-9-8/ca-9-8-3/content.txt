9.8.3 Trade-offs between Horizontal and Vertical Microprogramming

The trade-offs between horizontal and vertical microprogramming are the following:

1. Horizontal microprogramming requires more storage. However, this is not an issue in a microprogrammed processor. The additional storage is minimal.   
2. Horizontal microprogramming eliminates the need for dedicated signal generation logic in the Âµcontrol unit.   
3. To program a horizontally microprogrammed processor, it is necessary to expose the control signals to the programmer and the microassembler. This makes the microassembler very specific to a given processor. However, in vertical microprogramming, as long as the internal register set remains the same, we do not need different microassemblers.

To summarize, microprogramming is a very potent method to implement an instruction set. We can design very expressive instruction sets using this method. However, this is not a preferable approach for implementing all the instructions (especially the common ones) in a high performance processor.
