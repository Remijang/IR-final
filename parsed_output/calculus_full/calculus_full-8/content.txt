CHAPTER 8

Applications of the Integral

We are experts in one application of the integral—to find the area under a curve. The curve is the graph of  ; extending from  at the left to  at the right. The area between the curve and the  axis is the definite integral.

I think of that integral in the following way. The region is made up of thin strips. Their width is  and their height is  : The area of a strip is  times  : The area of all the strips is  : Strictly speaking, the area of one strip is meaningless—genuine rectangles have width  : My point is that the picture of thin strips gives the correct approach.

We know what function to integrate (from the picture). We also know how (from this course or a calculator). The new applications to volume and length and surface area cut up the region in new ways. Again the small pieces tell the story. In this chapter, what to integrate is more important than how.
