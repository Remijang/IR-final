CHAPTER 6

# Exponentials and Logarithms

This chapter is devoted to exponentials like $2 ^ { x }$ and $1 0 ^ { x }$ and above all $e ^ { x }$ : The goal is to understand them, differentiate them, integrate them, solve equations with them, and invert them (to reach the logarithm). The overwhelming importance of $e ^ { x }$ makes this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics.

In the traditional order of calculus books, $e ^ { x }$ waits until other applications of the integral are complete. I would like to explain why it is placed earlier here. I believe that the equation $d y / d x = y$ has to be emphasized above techniques of integration. The laws of nature are expressed by differential equations, and at the center is $e ^ { x }$ : Its applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering (and moreâ€”wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces a differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do.

The key is always $b ^ { m + n } = ( b ^ { m } ) ( b ^ { n } )$ : Section 6:1 applies that rule in three ways:

1. to understand the logarithm as the exponent;   
2. to draw graphs on ordinary and semilog and log-log paper;   
3. to find derivatives. The slope of $b ^ { x }$ will use $b ^ { x + \Delta x } = ( b ^ { x } ) ( b ^ { \Delta x } )$ :
