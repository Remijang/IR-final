6.4 Logarithms

We have given first place to  and a lower place to ln  : In applications that is absolutely correct. But log»arithms have one important» theoretical advantage (plus many applications of their own). The advantage is that the derivative of  is  ; whereas the derivative of  is  : We can’t define  as its own integral, without circular reasoning. But we can and do define  (the natural logarithm) as the integral of the “  power” which is  :

Note the dummy variables, first  then  : Note also the live variables, first  then  : Especially note the lower limit of integration, which is 1 and not 0: The logarithm is the area measured from 1. Therefore ln  at that starting poin¡t—as required.

Earlier chapters integrated all powers except this  power.” The logarithm is that missing integral. The curve in Figure 6.11 has height  —it is a hyperbola. At  the height goes to infinity and the area becomes infinite:  : The minus sign is because the integral goes backward from 1 to 0: The integral does not extend past zero to negative  : We are defining  only for  

With this new approach, ln  has a direct definition.  is an integral (or an area). Its two key properties must follo»w from thi»s definition. »That step is a beautiful application of the theory behind integrals.

Property 1:  : The areas from 1 to  and from  to  combine into a single area (1 to  in the middle figure):

The right side is  ; from definition (1). The first term on the left is  : The problem is to show that the second integral (  to  ) is  :

We need  when  (the lower limit) and  when  (the upper limit). The choice  satisfies these requirements. Substituting  and  a  yields  : Equation (3) gives  ; and equation (2) is   :

Property 2:  : These are the left and right sides of

This comes from the substitution  : The lower limit  corresponds to  ; and  corresponds to  : The differential  is  : Dividing by  leaves  : Then equation (4) becomes  :

Everything comes logically from the definition as an area. Also definite integrals:

EXAMPLE 1 Comp  EXAMPLE 2 Comput  EXAMPLE 3 Compute  : Solution: ln  : The area from 1 to  is 2:

Remark While working on the theory this is a chance to straighten out old debts. The book has discussed and computed (and even differentiated) the functions  and  and  ; without defining them properly. When the exponent is an irrational number like  ; how do we multiply  by itself  times ? One approach (not taken) is to come closer and closer to  by rational exponents like  : Another approach (taken now) is to determine the number  : : : by its logarithm.  Start with  itself:

When the area in Figure 6.12 reaches 1; the basepoint is e. When the area reaches  ; the basepoint is  : We are constructing the inverse function (which is  ). But how do we know that the area reaches  or 1000 or  at exactly one point ? (The area is 1000 far out at  : The area is  very near zero at  :) To define  we have to know that somewhere the area equals 1!

For a proof in two steps, go back to Figure 6.11c. The area from 1 to 2 is more than  (because  is more than  on that interval of length one). The combined area from 1 to 4 is more than 1: We come to area  before reaching 4: (Actually at  ) Since  is positive, the area is increasing and never comes back to 1:

To double the area we have to square the distance. The logarithm creeps upwards:

The logarithm grows slowly because  grows so fast (and vice versa—they are inverses). Remember that  goes past every power  : Therefore  is passed by every root  : Problems 60 and 61 give two proofs that  approaches zero.

We might compare ln  with  : At  they are close (2:3 versus 3:2). But out at  the comparison is 10 against  ; and ln  loses to  :

APPROXIMATION OF LOGARITHMS

The limiting cases  and ln  are important. More important are logarithms near the starting point ln  : Our question is: What is  for  near zero ? The exact answer is an area. The approximate answer is much simpler. If  (positive or negative) is small, then

The calculator gives ln  : This is close to  : Between 1 and  the ar2ea under the graph of  is nearly a rectangle. Its base is  and its height is 1: So the curved area  is close to the rectangular area  : Figure 6.14 shows how a small triangle is chopped off at the top.

The difference between .0099503 (actual) and .01 (linear approximation) is :0000497: That is predicted almost exactly by the second derivative:  times  times  is  : This is the area of the small triangle!

The remaining mistake of :0000003 is close to  (Problem 65).

May I switch to  ? Its slope starts at  ; so its linear approximation is  : Then  : Twowrongs do make a right:  exactly.

The calculator gives  as 1:0100502 (actual) instead of 1:01 (approximation). The second-order correction is again a small triangle:  : The complete series for  and  are in Sections 10:1 and 6:6 W

DERIVATIVES BASED ON LOGARITHMS

Logarithms turn up as antiderivatives very often. To build up a collection of integrals, we now differentiate ln  by the chain rule.

6.4 Logarithms

The slope of ln  was hard work in Section 6:2: With its new definition (the integral of  ) the work is gone. By the Fundamental Theorem, the slope must be  :

For ln  the derivative comes from the chain rule. The inside function is  ; the outside function is ln : (Keep  to define ln  :) The chain rule gives

Those are worth another look, especially the first. Any reasonable person would expect the slope of  to be  : Not so. The 3 cancels, and  has the same slope as  : (The real reason is that ln  ) The antiderivative of  is not ln  but  ; which is  :

Before moving to integrals, here is a new method for derivatives: logarithmic differentiation or LD. It applies to produ?cts and powers. The product and power rules are always available, but sometimes there is an easier way.

Main idea: The logarithm of a product  is a sum of logarithms. Switching to  ; the sum rule just adds up the derivatives. But there is a catch at the end, as you see in the example.

EXAMPLE 4 Find  if  : Here ln  ln  :

The catch is that last step. Multiplying by  complicates the answer. This can’t be helped—logarithmic differentiation contains no magic. The derivative of  is the same as from the product rule: ln  gives

For  ; with three factors, the sum has three terms:

We multiply  times  (the derivative of ln  ). Do the same for powers:

INTEGRALS BASED ON LOGARITHMS

Now comes an important step. Many integrals produce logarithms. The foremost example is  ; whose integral is ln  : In a certain way that is the only example, but its range is enormously extended by the chain rule. The derivative of  is  ; so the integral goes from  back to ln  :

Try to choose  so that the integral contains  divided by  :

EXAMPLES

Final remark When  is negative, ln  cannot be the integral of  : The logarithm is not defi ned when  : But the integral can go forward by switching to  :

Thus  succeeds when  fails. The forbidden case is  . The integrals  and  ; on the plus and minus sides of zero, can be combined as  : Every integral that gives a logarithm allows  by changing to the absolute value  :

The areas are  and  : The graphs of  and  are below t he  axis. We do not have l|og|arithms of negative numbers, and we will not integrate  from 2»to 6: That cro»sses the forbidden point  ; »with infinite area on both sides.

The ratio  leads to important integrals. When  or  ; we are integra»ting the tange»nt and cotangent. When there i»s a possibility that  ; write the integral as ln  :

Now w»e report on the»secant and cosecant. The integrals of  and  also surrender to an attack by logarithms—based on a crazy|trick:

Here  is in the denominator;  tan  is above it. The integral is ln  : Similarly (10) contains  over  :

6.4 Logarithms

In closing we integrate ln  itself. The derivative of  ln  is ln  : To remove the extra 1; subtract  from the integral:  ln  :

In contrast, the area under  has no elementary formula. Nevertheless it is the key to the greatest approximation in mathematics—the prime number theorem. The area  is approximately the number of primes between a and  . Near  ; about  of the integers are prime.
