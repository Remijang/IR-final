CHAPTER 6

Exponentials and Logarithms

This chapter is devoted to exponentials like  and  and above all  : The goal is to understand them, differentiate them, integrate them, solve equations with them, and invert them (to reach the logarithm). The overwhelming importance of  makes this a crucial chapter in pure and applied mathematics.

In the traditional order of calculus books,  waits until other applications of the integral are complete. I would like to explain why it is placed earlier here. I believe that the equation  has to be emphasized above techniques of integration. The laws of nature are expressed by differential equations, and at the center is  : Its applications are to life sciences and physical sciences and economics and engineering (and moreâ€”wherever change is influenced by the present state). The model produces a differential equation and I want to show what calculus can do.

The key is always  : Section 6:1 applies that rule in three ways:

1. to understand the logarithm as the exponent;   
2. to draw graphs on ordinary and semilog and log-log paper;   
3. to find derivatives. The slope of  will use  :
