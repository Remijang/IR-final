There has to be a definition and a computation to fall back on, when the single integrals are difficult or impossible. And also\u2014this we emphasize\u2014multiple integrals represent more than area and volume. Those words and the pictures that go with them are the easiest to understand. You can almost see the volume as a \u201csum of slices\u201d or a \u201cdouble sum of thin sticks.\u201d The true applications are mostly to other things, but the central idea is always the same: Add up small pieces and take limits.
