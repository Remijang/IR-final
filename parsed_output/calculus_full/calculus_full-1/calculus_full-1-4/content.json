        "text": "One new part of the subject has come with the computer. It works with a finite step $h$ , not an \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d limit. What it can do, it does quickly\u2014even if it cannot find exact slopes or areas. The result is an overwhelming growth in the range of problems that can be solved. We landed on the moon because $f$ and $v$ were so accurate. (The moon\u2019s orbit has sines and cosines, the spacecraft starts with $v = a t$ and $\\textstyle f = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } a t ^ { 2 }$ : Only the computer can account for the atmosphere and the sun\u2019s gravity and the changing mass of the spacecraft.) Modern mathematics is $\\pmb { a }$ combination of exact formulas and approximate computations. Neither part can be ignored, and I hope you will see numerically what we derive algebraically. The exercises are to help you master both parts. ",

        "text": "The course has made a quick start\u2014not with an abstract discussion of sets or functions or limits, but with the concrete questions that led to those ideas. You have seen a distance function $f$ and a limit $v$ of average velocities. We will meet more functions and more limits (and their definitions!) but it is crucial to study important examples early. There is a lot to do, but the course has definitely begun. ",
