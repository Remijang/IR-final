Specifically, upon each page access (i.e., each memory access, whether an instruction fetch or a load or store), we must update some data structure to move this page to the front of the list (i.e., the MRU side). Contrast this to FIFO, where the FIFO list of pages is only accessed when a page is evicted (by removing the first-in page) or when a new page is added to the list (to the last-in side). To keep track of which pages have been least- and most-recently used, the system has to do some accounting work on every memory reference. Clearly, without great care, such accounting could greatly reduce performance. ",

For example, a machine could update, on each page access, a time field in memory (for example, this could be in the per-process page table, or just in some separate array in memory, with one entry per physical page of the system). Thus, when a page is accessed, the time field would be set, by hardware, to the current time. Then, when replacing a page, the OS could simply scan all the time fields in the system to find the least-recently-used page. ",

Imagine a modern machine with 4GB of memory, chopped into 4KB pages. This machine has 1 million pages, and thus finding the LRU page will take a long time, even at modern CPU speeds. Which begs the question: do we really need to find the absolute oldest page to replace? Can we instead survive with an approximation? ",
