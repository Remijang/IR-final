Unlike file deletion, however, removing directories is more dangerous, as you could potentially delete a large amount of data with a single command. Thus, rmdir() has the requirement that the directory be empty (i.e., only has “.” and “..” entries) before it is deleted. If you try to delete a non-empty directory, the call to rmdir() simply will fail. ",
