First, run with flags $-  { \\mathrm { ~ T ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ I ~ o ~ g ~ } } -  { \\mathrm { ~ s ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } } -  { \\mathrm { ~ n ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ \\textrm ~ { ~ ~ } ~ } }  { \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ } } 0$ $- \\mathtt { q }$ .

To do so, we have to set the high $\\left( - \\mathsf { G } \\right)$ and low $( - { \\mathfrak { g } } )$ watermarks appropriately. First, let’s observe what happens when you run a larger workload to the log-structured SSD but without any garbage collection. To do this, run with flags -T log -n 1000 (the high watermark default is 10, so the GC won’t run in this configuration). What do you think will happen?

What do you notice about the GC? The final effect of ${ \\mathrm { G C } } ,$ of course, is performance. Use $- S$ to look at final statistics; how many extra reads and writes occur due to garbage collection? Compare this to the ideal SSD (-T ideal); how much extra reading, writing, and erasing is there due to the nature of Flash? Compare it also to the direct approach; in what way (erases, reads, programs) is the log-structured approach superior? ",

For example, running with $- \\mathtt { K }$ $8 0 / 2 0$ makes $8 0 \\%$ of the writes go to $2 0 \\%$ of the blocks. Pick some different skews and perform many randomly-chosen operations (e.g., $- \\mathtt { n } \\mathtt { \\nabla } 1 0 0 0 \\mathtt { \\Gamma }$ ), using first $- \\mathrm { T }$ direct to understand the skew, and then $- \\mathbb { T } \\quad \\bot \\bigcirc \\mathfrak { g }$ to see the impact on a log-structured device. What do you expect will happen? One other small skew control to explore is $- \\mathbf { k }$ 100; by adding this flag to a skewed workload, the first 100 writes are not skewed. The idea is to first create a lot of data, but then only update some of it. What impact might that have upon a garbage collector? ",
