The file system will thus search through the bitmap for an inode that is free, and allocate it to the file; the file system will have to mark the inode as used (with a 1) and eventually update the on-disk bitmap with the correct information. A similar set of activities take place when a data block is allocated. ",

For example, some Linux file systems, such as ext2 and ext3, will look for a sequence of blocks (say 8) that are free when a new file is created and needs data blocks; by finding such a sequence of free blocks, and then allocating them to the newly-created file, the file system guarantees that a portion of the file will be contiguous on the disk, thus improving performance. Such a pre-allocation policy is thus a commonly-used heuristic when allocating space for data blocks. ",
