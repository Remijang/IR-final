Thus the era of multiprogramming was born [DV66], in which multiple processes were ready to run at a given time, and the OS would switch between them, for example when one decided to perform an I/O. Doing so increased the effective utilization of the CPU. Such increases in efficiency were particularly important in those days where each machine cost hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars (and you thought your Mac was expensive!). ",

Specifically, many realized the limitations of batch computing, particularly on programmers themselves [CV65], who were tired of long (and hence ineffective) program-debug cycles. The notion of interactivity became important, as many users might be concurrently using a machine, each waiting for (or hoping for) a timely response from their currently-executing tasks. ",
