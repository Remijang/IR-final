Compute the size of linear page tables as different parameters change. Some suggested inputs are below; by using the $- \\tau$ flag, you can see how many page-table entries are filled. First, to understand how linear page table size changes as the address space grows, run with these flags: Then, to understand how linear page table size changes as page size grows: Before running any of these, try to think about the expected trends. How should page-table size change as the address space grows? As the page size grows? Why not use big pages in general? ",
