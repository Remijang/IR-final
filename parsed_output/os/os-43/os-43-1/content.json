To understand this better, let’s use a simple example. Imagine we are writing a data block $D$ to a file. Writing the data block to disk might result in the following on-disk layout, with $D$ written at disk address $\\mathbf { \\nabla } A 0$ : ",

When written to disk, the data block and inode would look something like this (note that the inode looks as big as the data block, which generally isn’t the case; in most systems, data blocks are $4 \\mathrm { K B }$ in size, whereas an inode is much smaller, around 128 bytes): ",
