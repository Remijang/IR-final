By turning off interrupts (using some kind of special hardware instruction) before entering a critical section, we ensure that the code inside the critical section will not be interrupted, and thus will execute as if it were atomic. When we are finished, we re-enable interrupts (again, via a hardware instruction) and thus the program proceeds as usual. ",

First, this approach requires us to allow any calling thread to perform a privileged operation (turning interrupts on and off), and thus trust that this facility is not abused. As you already know, any time we are required to trust an arbitrary program, we are probably in trouble. Here, the trouble manifests in numerous ways: a greedy program could call lock() at the beginning of its execution and thus monopolize the processor; worse, an errant or malicious program could call lock() and go into an endless loop. In this latter case, the OS never regains control of the system, and there is only one recourse: restart the system. Using interrupt disabling as a generalpurpose synchronization solution requires too much trust in applications. ",

        "text": "Second, the approach does not work on multiprocessors. If multiple threads are running on different CPUs, and each try to enter the same critical section, it does not matter whether interrupts are disabled; threads will be able to run on other processors, and thus could enter the critical section. As multiprocessors are now commonplace, our general solution will have to do better than this. ",

For example, in some cases an operating system itself will use interrupt masking to guarantee atomicity when accessing its own data structures, or at least to prevent certain messy interrupt handling situations from arising. This usage makes sense, as the trust issue disappears inside the OS, which always trusts itself to perform privileged operations anyhow. ",
