The downside, of course, can be a negative performance impact, as we might needlessly wake up many other waiting threads that shouldn’t (yet) be awake.

In general, if you find that your program only works when you change your signals to broadcasts (but you don’t think it should need to), you probably have a bug; fix it! But in cases like the memory allocator above, broadcast may be the most straightforward solution available. ",
