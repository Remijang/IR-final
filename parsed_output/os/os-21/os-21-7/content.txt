21.7 Summary
In this brief chapter, we have introduced the notion of accessing more memory than is physically present within a system. To do so requires more complexity in page-table structures, as a present bit (of some kind) must be included to tell us whether the page is present in memory or not. When not, the operating system page-fault handler runs to service the page fault, and thus arranges for the transfer of the desired page from disk to memory, perhaps first replacing some pages in memory to make room for those soon to be swapped in.  
Recall, importantly (and amazingly!), that these actions all take place transparently to the process. As far as the process is concerned, it is just accessing its own private, contiguous virtual memory. Behind the scenes, pages are placed in arbitrary (non-contiguous) locations in physical memory, and sometimes they are not even present in memory, requiring a fetch from disk. While we hope that in the common case a memory access is fast, in some cases it will take multiple disk operations to service it; something as simple as performing a single instruction can, in the worst case, take many milliseconds to complete.
