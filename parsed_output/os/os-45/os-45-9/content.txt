45.9 Summary
We have discussed data protection in modern storage systems, focusing on checksum implementation and usage. Different checksums protect against different types of faults; as storage devices evolve, new failure modes will undoubtedly arise. Perhaps such change will force the research community and industry to revisit some of these basic approaches, or invent entirely new approaches altogether. Time will tell. Or it won’t. Time is funny that way.

The first paper to study latent sector errors in detail. The paper also won the Kenneth C. Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper award, named after a brilliant researcher and wonderful guy who passed away too soon. To show the OSTEP authors it was possible to move from the U.S. to Canada, Ken once sang us the Canadian national anthem, standing up in the middle of a restaurant to do so. We chose the U.S., but got this memory. $\left[ { \tt B } { + } 0 8 \right]$ “An Analysis of Data Corruption in the Storage Stack” by Lakshmi N. Bairavasundaram, Garth R.

FAST $' 0 4$ , San Jose, CA, February 2004. An early paper on how extra redundancy helps to solve the combined full-disk-failure/partial-disk-failure problem. Also a nice example of how to mix more theoretical work with practical.

[F82] “An Arithmetic Checksum for Serial Transmissions” by John G. Fletcher. IEEE Transactions on Communication, Vol. 30:1, January 1982. Fletcher’s original work on his eponymous checksum. He didn’t call it the Fletcher checksum, rather he just didn’t call it anything; later, others named it after him. So don’t blame old Fletch for this seeming act of braggadocio. This anecdote might remind you of Rubik; Rubik never called it “Rubik’s cube”; rather, he just called it “my cube.”

We reveal a number of interesting flaws in current protection strategies.

Our paper on how disks have partial failure modes, and a detailed study of how modern file systems react to such failures. As it turns out, rather poorly! We found numerous bugs, design flaws, and other oddities in this work. Some of this has fed back into the Linux community, thus improving file system reliability. You’re welcome!
