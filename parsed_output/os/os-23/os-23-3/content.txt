23.3 Summary
You have now seen a top-to-bottom review of two virtual memory systems. Hopefully, most of the details were easy to follow, as you should have already had a good understanding of the basic mechanisms and policies. More detail on VAX/VMS is available in the excellent (and short) paper by Levy and Lipman [LL82]. We encourage you to read it, as it is a great way to see what the source material behind these chapters is like.  
You have also learned a bit about Linux. While a large and complex system, it inherits many good ideas from the past, many of which we have not had room to discuss in detail. For example, Linux performs lazy copy-on-write copying of pages upon fork(), thus lowering overheads by avoiding unnecessary copying. Linux also demand zeroes pages (using memory-mapping of the /dev/zero device), and has a background swap daemon (swapd) that swaps pages to disk to reduce memory pressure. Indeed, the VM is filled with good ideas taken from the past, and also includes many of its own innovations.  
To learn more, check out these reasonable (but, alas, outdated) books [BC05,G04]. We encourage you to read them on your own, as we can only provide the merest drop from what is an ocean of complexity. But, you’ve got to start somewhere. What is any ocean, but a multitude of drops? [M04]

But it’d be hard for these authors not to pick “Cloud Atlas”, a fantastic, sprawling epic about the human condition, from where the the last quote of this chapter is lifted. If you are smart – and we think you are – you should stop reading obscure commentary in the references and instead read “Cloud Atlas”; you’ll thank us later.
