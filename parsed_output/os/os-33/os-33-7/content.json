The reason is as follows: when an event handler issues an asynchronous I/O, it must package up some program state for the next event handler to use when the I/O finally completes; this additional work is not needed in thread-based programs, as the state the program needs is on the stack of the thread. Adya et al. call this work manual stack management, and it is fundamental to event-based programming $\\left[ { \\mathrm { A } } { + } 0 2 \\right]$ . ",

For example, when your program encounters a segmentation violation, the OS sends it a SIGSEGV (prepending SIG to signal names is common); if your program is configured to catch that signal, you can actually run some code in response to this erroneous program behavior (which is helpful for debugging). When a signal is sent to a process not configured to handle a signal, the default behavior is enacted; for SEGV, the process is killed. ",
