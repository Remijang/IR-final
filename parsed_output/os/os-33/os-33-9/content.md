# 33.9 Summary  

Weâ€™ve presented a bare bones introduction to a different style of concurrency based on events. Event-based servers give control of scheduling to the application itself, but do so at some cost in complexity and difficulty of integration with other aspects of modern systems (e.g., paging). Because of these challenges, no single approach has emerged as best; thus, both threads and events are likely to persist as two different approaches to the same concurrency problem for many years to come. Read some research papers (e.g., $[ \mathrm { A } { + } 0 2$ , PDZ99, $\mathbf { v B + } 0 3$ , WCB01]) or better yet, write some event-based code, to learn more.
