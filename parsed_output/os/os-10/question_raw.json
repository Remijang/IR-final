The first simulation will run just one job, which has a run-time of 30, and a working-set size of 200. Run this job (called job $' \\mathrm { a ^ { \\prime } }$ here) on one simulated CPU as follows: ./multi.py $- \\texttt { n 1 } - \\texttt { L a : } 3 0 : 2 0 0$ . How long will it take to complete? Turn on the $- c$ flag to see a final answer, and the -t flag to see a tick-by-tick trace of the job and how it is scheduled.",

Now increase the cache size so as to make the job’s working set (siz ${ \\boldsymbol { \\cdot } } = 2 0 0$ ) fit into the cache (which, by default, is size $_ { \\cdot = 1 0 0 }$ ); for example, run ./multi.py $- \\texttt { n 1 } - \\texttt { L a : 3 0 : 2 0 0 } - \\texttt { M 3 0 0 }$ . Can you predict how fast the job will run once it fits in cache?

Run the same simulation as above, but this time with time left tracing enabled $( - \\mathtt { T } )$ . This flag shows both the job that was scheduled on a CPU at each time step, as well as how much run-time that job has left after each tick has run. What do you notice about how that second column decreases?",

At what point does the cache become warm for job $' \\mathrm { a ^ { \\prime } }$ in this simple example?

Oh yeah! So let’s start working with multiple jobs. Specifically, let’s run the following three jobs on a two-CPU system (i.e., type ./multi.py -n $\\begin{array} { r l } { { 2 } } & { { } \\mathrm { - } \\mathrm { L } \\ : \\ : \\mathtt { a } : 1 0 0 : 1 0 0 , \\mathtt { b } : 1 0 0 : 5 0 , \\mathtt { c } : 1 0 0 : 5 0 \\ : ) } \\end{array}$ Can you predict how long this will take, given a round-robin centralized scheduler? Use $- c$ to see if you were right, and then dive down into details with -t to see a step-by-step and then $- \\mathsf { C }$ to see whether caches got warmed effectively for these jobs.

This flag can be used to limit which CPUs the scheduler can place a particular job upon. In this case, let’s use it to place jobs $\\mathbf { \\bar { \\tau } } _ { \\mathbf { b } ^ { \\prime } }$ and $\\mathrm { ^ { \\prime } c } ^ { \\bar { \\prime } }$ on CPU 1, while restricting $' \\mathrm { a ^ { \\prime } }$ to CPU 0. This magic is accomplished by typing this ./multi.py $- \\nmid 2 - \\mathrm { { \\bar { L } } } { \\mathsf { a } } : 1 0 0 : 1 0 0 , { \\mathsf { b } } : 1 0 0 : 5 0 ,$ , $c : 1 0 0 : 5 0 - \\mathbb { A } \\ \\mathsf { a } : 0 , \\mathsf { b } : 1 , \\mathsf { c } : 1$ ; don’t forget to turn on various tracing options to see what is really happening! Can you predict how fast this version will run? Why does it do better? Will other combinations of $\\mathbf { \\bar { a } ^ { \\prime } } , \\mathbf { \\bar { b } ^ { \\prime } }$ , and $' \\mathrm { c } ^ { \\prime }$ onto the two processors run faster or slower? ",

One interesting aspect of caching multiprocessors is the opportunity for better-than-expected speed up of jobs when using multiple CPUs (and their caches) as compared to running jobs on a single processor. Specifically, when you run on $N$ CPUs, sometimes you can speed up by more than a factor of $N$ , a situation entitled super-linear speedup. To experiment with this, use the job description here $\\left( - \\mathtt { L } \\ \\mathtt { a } : 1 0 0 : 1 0 0 , \\mathtt { b } : 1 0 0 : 1 0 0 , \\mathtt { c } : 1 0 0 : 1 0 0 \\right)$ with a small cache $\\left( - \\mathbb { M } \\ \\mathtt { 5 0 } \\right)$ to create three jobs. Run this on systems with 1, 2, and 3 CPUs $( - \\mathtt { n } \\mathtt { 1 } , - \\mathtt { n } \\mathtt { 2 } , - \\mathtt { n } \\mathtt { 3 } )$ . Now, do the same, but with a larger per-CPU cache of size 100. What do you notice about performance as the number of CPUs scales? Use $- c$ to confirm your guesses, and other tracing flags to dive even deeper. ",

How does this option do, as opposed to the hand-controlled affinity limits you put in place above?
