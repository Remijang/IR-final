        "text": "We now summarize our simplified comparison of RAID levels in Figure 38.8. Note that we have omitted a number of details to simplify our analysis. For example, when writing in a mirrored system, the average seek time is a little higher than when writing to just a single disk, because the seek time is the max of two seeks (one on each disk). Thus, random write performance to two disks will generally be a little less than random write performance of a single disk. Also, when updating the parity disk in RAID-4/5, the first read of the old parity will likely cause a full seek and rotation, but the second write of the parity will only result in rotation. Finally, sequential I/O to mirrored RAIDs pay a $2 \\times$ performance penalty as compared to other approaches1. ",

        "text": "However, the comparison in Figure 38.8 does capture the essential differences, and is useful for understanding tradeoffs across RAID levels. For the latency analysis, we simply use $T$ to represent the time that a request to a single disk would take. ",

        "text": "To conclude, if you strictly want performance and do not care about reliability, striping is obviously best. If, however, you want random I/O performance and reliability, mirroring is the best; the cost you pay is in lost capacity. If capacity and reliability are your main goals, then RAID5 is the winner; the cost you pay is in small-write performance. Finally, if you are always doing sequential I/O and want to maximize capacity, RAID-5 also makes the most sense. ",
