Specifically, if a temporary or short-lived file was created on a client and then soon deleted, it would still be forced to the server. A more ideal implementation might keep such short-lived files in memory until they are deleted and thus remove the server interaction entirely, perhaps increasing performance. ",

Sometimes you would get the latest version; sometimes you would get an old version simply because your attribute cache hadn’t yet timed out and thus the client was happy to give you what was in client memory. Although this was fine most of the time, it would (and still does!) occasionally lead to odd behavior. ",
