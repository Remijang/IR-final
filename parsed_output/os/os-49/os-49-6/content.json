The client-side file system tracks open files, and generally translates application requests into the relevant set of protocol messages. The server simply responds to protocol messages, each of which contains all of the information needed to complete the request. ",

        "text": "A few comments about the figure. First, notice how the client tracks all relevant state for the file access, including the mapping of the integer file descriptor to an NFS file handle as well as the current file pointer. This enables the client to turn each read request (which you may have noticed do not specify the offset to read from explicitly) into a properly-formatted read protocol message which tells the server exactly which bytes from the file to read. Upon a successful read, the client updates the current file position; subsequent reads are issued with the same file handle but a different offset. ",

    },
    {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Second, you may notice where server interactions occur. When the file is opened for the first time, the client-side file system sends a LOOKUP request message. Indeed, if a long pathname must be traversed (e.g., /home/remzi/foo.txt), the client would send three LOOKUPs: one to look up home in the directory /, one to look up remzi in home, and finally one to look up foo.txt in remzi.

This design point is critical to be able to gracefully recover from server failure, as we will now discuss in more detail; it ensures that the server does not need state to be able to respond to the request.
