49.2 On To NFS
One of the earliest and quite successful distributed systems was developed by Sun Microsystems, and is known as the Sun Network File System (or NFS) [S86]. In defining NFS, Sun took an unusual approach: instead of building a proprietary and closed system, Sun instead developed an open protocol which simply specified the exact message formats that clients and servers would use to communicate. Different groups could develop their own NFS servers and thus compete in an NFS marketplace while preserving interoperability. It worked: today there are many companies that sell NFS servers (including Oracle/Sun, NetApp [HLM94], EMC, IBM, and others), and the widespread success of NFS is likely attributed to this “open market” approach.
