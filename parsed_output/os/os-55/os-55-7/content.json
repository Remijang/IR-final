Access control lists specify precisely which subjects can access which objects in which ways. Presence or absence on the relevant list determines if access is granted. Capabilities work more like keys in a lock. Possession of the correct capability is sufficient proof that access to a resource should be permitted. User-visible access control is more commonly achieved with a form of access control list, but capabilities are often built in to the operating system at a level below what the user sees. Neither of these access control mechanisms is inherently better or worse than the other. Rather, like so many options in system design, they have properties that are well suited to some situations and uses and poorly suited to others. You need to understand how to choose which one to use in which circumstance. ",
