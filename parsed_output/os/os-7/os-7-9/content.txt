7.9 No More Oracle
With a basic approach to I/O in place, we come to our final assumption: that the scheduler knows the length of each job. As we said before, this is likely the worst assumption we could make. In fact, in a generalpurpose OS (like the ones we care about), the OS usually knows very little about the length of each job. Thus, how can we build an approach that behaves like SJF/STCF without such a priori knowledge? Further, how can we incorporate some of the ideas we have seen with the RR scheduler so that response time is also quite good?
