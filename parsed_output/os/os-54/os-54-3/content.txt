54.3 How To Authenticate Users?
So this human being walks up to a computer...  
Assuming we leave aside the possibilities for jokes, what can be done to allow the system to determine who this person is, with reasonable accuracy? First, if the person is not an authorized user of the system at all, we should totally reject this attempt to sneak in. Second, if he or she is an authorized user, we need to determine, which one?  
Classically, authenticating the identity of human beings has worked in one of three ways:  
• Authentication based on what you know • Authentication based on what you have • Authentication based on what you are  
When we say “classically” here, we mean “classically” in the, well, classical sense. Classically as in going back to the ancient Greeks and

Romans. For example, Polybius, writing in the second century B.C., describes how the Roman army used “watchwords” to distinguish friends from foes [P-46], an example of authentication based on what you know. A Roman architect named Celer wrote a letter of recommendation (which still survives) for one of his slaves to be given to an imperial procurator at some time in the 2nd century AD [C100] – authentication based on what the slave had. Even further back, in (literally) Biblical times, the Gileadites required refugees after a battle to say the word “shibboleth,” since the enemies they sought (the Ephraimites) could not properly pronounce that word [JB-500]. This was a form of authentication by what you are: a native speaker of the Gileadites’ dialect or of the Ephraimite dialect.  
Having established the antiquity of these methods of authentication, let’s leap past several centuries of history to the Computer Era to discuss how we use them in the context of computer authentication.
