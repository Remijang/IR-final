In particular, the designers were extremely worried about accommodating small files; as it turned out, many files were 2KB or so in size back then, and using 4KB blocks, while good for transferring data, was not so good for space efficiency. This internal fragmentation could thus lead to roughly half the disk being wasted for a typical file system. ",

In those times (before SCSI and other more modern device interfaces), disks were much less sophisticated and required the host CPU to control their operation in a more hands-on way. A problem arose in FFS when a file was placed on consecutive sectors of the disk, as on the left in Figure 41.3. ",

By skipping over every other block (in the example), FFS has enough time to request the next block before it went past the disk head. In fact, FFS was smart enough to figure out for a particular disk how many blocks it should skip in doing layout in order to avoid the extra rotations; this technique was called parameterization, as FFS would figure out the specific performance parameters of the disk and use those to decide on the exact staggered layout scheme.

Long file names, symbolic links, and a rename operation that worked atomically all improved the utility of a system; while hard to write a research paper about (imagine trying to read a 14-pager about “The Symbolic Link: Hard Link’s Long Lost Cousin”), such small features made FFS more useful and thus likely increased its chances for adoption.

FFS was one of the first file systems to allow for long file names, thus enabling more expressive names in the file system instead of the traditional fixed-size approach (e.g., 8 characters). Further, a new concept was introduced called a symbolic link. As discussed in a previous chapter [AD14b] , hard links are limited in that they both could not point to directories (for fear of introducing loops in the file system hierarchy) and that they can only point to files within the same volume (i.e., the inode number must still be meaningful). Symbolic links allow the user to create an “alias” to any other file or directory on a system and thus are much more flexible. FFS also introduced an atomic rename() operation for renaming files. Usability improvements, beyond the basic technology, also likely gained FFS a stronger user base. ",
