For example, there is a lot of networking code in the operating system; we leave it to you to take the networking class to learn more about that. Similarly, graphics devices are particularly important; take the graphics course to expand your knowledge in that direction. Finally, some operating system books talk a great deal about security; we will do so in the sense that the OS must provide protection between running programs and give users the ability to protect their files, but we won’t delve into deeper security issues that one might find in a security course.
