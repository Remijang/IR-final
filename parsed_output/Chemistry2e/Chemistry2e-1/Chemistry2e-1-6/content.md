# 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the dimensional analysis (factor label) approach to mathematical calculations involving quantities • Use dimensional analysis to carry out unit conversions for a given property and computations involving two or more properties

It is often the case that a quantity of interest may not be easy (or even possible) to measure directly but instead must be calculated from other directly measured properties and appropriate mathematical relationships. For example, consider measuring the average speed of an athlete running sprints. This is typically accomplished by measuring the timerequired for the athlete to run from the starting line to the finish line, and the distance between these two lines, and then computing spe dfrom the equation that relates these three properties:

$$
{ \mathrm { s p e e d } } = { \frac { \mathrm { d i s t a n c e } } { \mathrm { t i m e } } }
$$

An Olympic-quality sprinter can run $1 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ in approximately 10 s, corresponding to an average speed of

$$
{ \frac { 1 0 0 \mathrm { m } } { 1 0 \mathrm { s } } } = 1 0 \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s }
$$

Note that this simple arithmetic involves dividing the numbers of each measured quantity to yield the number of the computed quantity $( 1 0 0 / 1 0 = 1 0 \$ ) andlikewisedividing the units of each measured quantity to yield the unit of the computed quantity $( \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s } = \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s } )$ ). Now, consider using this same relation to predict the time required for a person running at this speed to travel a distance of $2 5 \mathrm { m }$ . The same relation among the three properties is used, but in this case, the two quantities provided are a speed $( 1 0 \mathrm { m / s } )$ and a distance $( 2 5 \mathrm { m } )$ . To yield the sought property, time, the equation must be rearranged appropriately:

$$
{ \mathrm { t i m e } } = { \frac { \mathrm { d i s t a n c e } } { \mathrm { s p e e d } } }
$$

The time can then be computed as:

$$
\frac { 2 5 \mathrm { m } } { 1 0 \mathrm { m / s } } = 2 . 5 \mathrm { s }
$$

Again, arithmetic on the numbers $( 2 5 / 1 0 = 2 . 5 )$ ) was accompanied by the same arithmetic on the units $\mathrm { { ( m / ( m / s ) } }$ $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { S } ,$ ) to yield the number and unit of the result, 2.5 s. Note that, just as for numbers, when a unit is divided by an identical unit (in this case, $\mathrm { m } / \mathrm { m } ,$ ), the result is “1”—or, as commonly phrased, the units “cancel.”

These calculations are examples of a versatile mathematical approach known as dimensional analysis (or the factor-label method). Dimensional analysis is based on this premise: theunitsofquantitiesmustbesubjected tothesamemathematicaloperationsastheiras ociatednumbers. This method can be applied to computations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities.

# Conversion Factors and Dimensional Analysis

A ratio of two equivalent quantities expressed with different measurement units can be used as a unit conversion factor. For example, the lengths of $2 . 5 4 \mathrm { c m }$ and 1 in. are equivalent (by definition), and so a unit conversion factor may be derived from the ratio,

$$
{ \frac { 2 . 5 4 \ \mathrm { c m } } { 1 \ \mathrm { i n } . } } \ ( 2 . 5 4 \ \mathrm { c m } = 1 \ \mathrm { i n } . ) \ \mathrm { o r } \ 2 . 5 4 \ { \frac { \mathrm { c m } } { \mathrm { i n } . } }
$$

Several other commonly used conversion factors are given in Table 1.6.

When a quantity (such as distance in inches) is multiplied by an appropriate unit conversion factor, the quantity is converted to an equivalent value with different units (such as distance in centimeters). For example, a basketball player’s vertical jump of 34 inches can be converted to centimeters by:

$$
3 4 \div \mathrm { \dot { m } } \cdot \mathrm { \times } ~ \frac { 2 . 5 4 \mathrm { c m } } { 1 \dot { \mathrm { m } } } = 8 6 \mathrm { c m }
$$

Since this simple arithmetic involves quantities, the premise of dimensional analysis requires that we multiply both numbersandunits. The numbers of these two quantities are multiplied to yield the number of the product quantity, 86, whereas the units are multiplied to yield $\frac { \mathrm { i n . \times c m } } { \mathrm { i n . } }$ . Just as for numbers, a ratio of identical units is also numerically equal to one, $\begin{array} { r } { \frac { \mathrm { i n . } } { \mathrm { i n . } } \ = 1 } \end{array}$ and the unit product thus simplifies to cm. (When identical units divide to yield a factor of 1, they are said to “cancel.”) Dimensional analysis may be used to confirm the proper application of unit conversion factors as demonstrated in the following example.

# EXAMPLE 1.8

# Using a Unit Conversion Factor

The mass of a competition frisbee is $\boldsymbol { 1 2 5 } \mathrm { g }$ . Convert its mass to ounces using the unit conversion factor derived

from the relationship $1 0 \mathrm { z } = 2 8 . 3 4 9 \ \mathrm { g }$ (Table 1.6).

# Solution

Given the conversion factor, the mass in ounces may be derived using an equation similar to the one used for converting length from inches to centimeters.

$$
x _ { Ḋ } 0 Ḍ z = 1 2 5 \mathrm { g } _ { Ḋ } \times \mathrm { u n i t c o n v e r s i o n f a c t o r }
$$

The unit conversion factor may be represented as:

$$
{ \frac { 1 \ { \mathrm { o z } } } { 2 8 . 3 4 9 \ { \mathrm { g } } } } \ { \mathrm { a n d } } \ { \frac { 2 8 . 3 4 9 \ { \mathrm { g } } } { 1 \ { \mathrm { o z } } } }
$$

The correct unit conversion factor is the ratio that cancels the units of grams and leaves ounces.

$$
{ \begin{array} { r l } { x \ \mathrm { o z } \ = \ } & { 1 2 5 \ \mathrm { \underline { { g } } } \ \times \ { \frac { 1 \ \mathrm { o z } } { 2 8 . 3 4 9 \ \mathrm { \underline { { g } } } } } } \\ { \ } & { = \ \left( { \frac { 1 2 5 } { 2 8 . 3 4 9 } } \right) \ \mathrm { o z } } \\ { \ } & { = \ 4 . 4 1 \ \mathrm { o z } \ ( { \mathrm { t h r e e \ s i g n i f } } } \end{array} }
$$

# Answer: 8.844 L

Beyond simple unit conversions, the factor-label method can be used to solve more complex problems involving computations. Regardless of the details, the basic approach is the same—all the factorsinvolved in the calculation must be appropriately oriented to ensure that their labels(units) will appropriately cancel and/ or combine to yield the desired unit in the result. As your study of chemistry continues, you will encounter many opportunities to apply this approach.

# EXAMPLE 1.9

# Computing Quantities from Measurement Results and Known Mathematical Relations

What is the density of common antifreeze in units of g/mL? A 4.00-qt sample of the antifreeze weighs 9.26 l

# Solution

Since $= { \frac { \mathrm { m a s s } } { \mathrm { v o l u m e } } }$ , we need to divide the mass in grams by the volume in milliliters. In general: the number of units of $\mathtt { B } =$ the number of units of $\mathsf { A } \times$ unit conversion factor. The necessary conversion factors are given in Table $\pm . 6$ : $1 \mathrm { l b } = 4 5 3 . 5 9 \mathrm { g } ; 1 \mathrm { L } = 1 . 0 5 6 7$ qt; $1 \mathrm { L } = 1 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { m L }$ . Mass may be converted from pounds to grams as follows:

$$
9 . 2 6 \# \ * { \bf \mathcal { H } } \times \frac { 4 5 3 . 5 9 \mathrm { ~ g } } { 1 \# } = 4 . 2 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { ~ g }
$$

Volume may be converted from quarts to milliliters via two steps:

Step 1. Convertquartstoliters.

$$
4 . 0 0 \mathrm { \# } \times \frac { 1 \mathrm { L } } { 1 . 0 5 6 7 \mathrm { \# } } = 3 . 7 8 \mathrm { L }
$$

Step 2. Convertliterstomililiters.

$$
3 . 7 8 \pm \times { \frac { 1 0 0 0 { \mathrm { m L } } } { 1 \pm } } = 3 . 7 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } { \mathrm { m L } }
$$

Then,

$$
\mathrm { \ d e n s i t y } = { \frac { 4 . 2 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } { \mathrm { g } } } { 3 . 7 8 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } { \mathrm { m L } } } } = 1 . 1 1 { \mathrm { g / m L } }
$$

Alternatively, the calculation could be set up in a way that uses three unit conversion factors sequentially as follows:

$$
\frac { 9 . 2 6 + 1 6 - } { 4 . 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mathrm { { q } \mathrm { + } } } \times \frac { 4 5 3 . 5 9 \mathrm { { g } } } { 1 \mathrm { { + } } \mathrm { { b } ^ { - } } } \times \frac { 1 . 0 5 6 7 \mathrm { { - } \mathrm { { q } \mathrm { + } } } } { 1 \mathrm { { - } } } \times \frac { 1 \mathrm { { L } } } { 1 0 0 0 \mathrm { { m L } } } = 1 . 1 1 \mathrm { { g / m L } }
$$

# EXAMPLE 1.10

# Computing Quantities from Measurement Results and Known Mathematical Relations

While being driven from Philadelphia to Atlanta, a distance of about $1 2 5 0 \mathrm { k m }$ , a 2014 Lamborghini Aventador Roadster uses 213 L gasoline.

(a) What (average) fuel economy, in miles per gallon, did the Roadster get during this trip? (b) If gasoline costs $\$ 3.80$ per gallon, what was the fuel cost for this trip?

# Solution

(a) First convert distance from kilometers to miles:

$$
1 2 5 0 \mathrm { { + } m r \times \frac { 0 . 6 2 1 3 7 \mathrm { { m i } } } { 1 \mathrm { { k m } } } = 7 7 7 \mathrm { { m i } } }
$$

and then convert volume from liters to gallons:

$$
2 1 3 \mathrm { { + } \times \frac { 1 . 0 5 6 7 \mathrm { { - } \mathrm { { q } } \mathrm { { t } } } } { 1 \mathrm { { - } } } \times \frac { 1 \mathrm { { g } a l } } { 4 \mathrm { { - } \mathrm { { q } } \mathrm { { t } } } } = 5 6 . 3 \mathrm { { g a l } } }
$$

Finally,

$$
( { \mathrm { a v e r a g e } } ) { \mathrm { m i l e a g e } } = { \frac { 7 7 7 { \mathrm { m i } } } { 5 6 . 3 { \mathrm { g a l } } } } = 1 3 . 8 { \mathrm { m i l e s / g a l l o n } } = 1 3 . 8 { \mathrm { m p g } }
$$

Alternatively, the calculation could be set up in a way that uses all the conversion factors sequentially, as follows:

$$
{ \frac { 1 2 5 0 \mathrm { + } \mathrm { m r } } { 2 1 3 \mathrm { + } } } \times { \frac { 0 . 6 2 1 3 7 \mathrm { m i } } { 1 \mathrm { + } \mathrm { m r } } } \times { \frac { 1 \mathrm { + } } { 1 . 0 5 6 7 \mathrm { - } \mathrm { q } \mathrm { + } } } \times { \frac { 4 \mathrm { - } \mathrm { q } \mathrm { t } } { 1 \mathrm { ~ g a l } } } = 1 3 . 8 \mathrm { m p g }
$$

(b) Using the previously calculated volume in gallons, we find:

$$
5 6 . 3 \mathrm { \ - g a t } \times \frac { \mathbb { S } 3 . 8 0 } { 1 \mathrm { \ - g a t } } = \mathbb { S } 2 1 4
$$

(a) What (average) fuel economy, in miles per gallon, did the Prius get during this trip? (b) If gasoline costs $\$ 3.90$ per gallon, what was the fuel cost for this trip?

# Conversion of Temperature Units

We use the word temperature to refer to the hotness or coldness of a substance. One way we measure a change in temperature is to use the fact that most substances expand when their temperature increases and contract when their temperature decreases. The liquid in a common glass thermometer changes its volume as the temperature changes, and the position of the trapped liquid's surface along a printed scale may be used as a measure of temperature.

Temperature scales are defined relative to selected reference temperatures: Two of the most commonly used are the freezing and boiling temperatures of water at a specified atmospheric pressure. On the Celsius scale, 0 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ is defined as the freezing temperature of water and $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ as the boiling temperature of water. The space between the two temperatures is divided into 100 equal intervals, which we call degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is defined as $3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }$ and the boiling temperature as $2 1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } .$ . The space between these two points on a Fahrenheit thermometer is divided into 180 equal parts (degrees).

Defining the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales as described in the previous paragraph results in a slightly more complex relationship between temperature values on these two scales than for different units of measure for other properties. Most measurement units for a given property are directly proportional to one another $\operatorname { \left( y = m x \right) }$ . Using familiar length units as one example:

$$
{ \mathrm { l e n g t h i n f e e t } } = \left( { \frac { 1 \mathrm { f t } } { 1 2 \mathrm { i n . } } } \right) \times \mathrm { l e n g t h i n i n c h e s }
$$

where $\mathbf { y } = \mathbf { \partial }$ length in feet, $\mathbf { X } = \mathbf { \partial }$ length in inches, and the proportionality constant, m, is the conversion factor. The Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, however, do not share a common zero point, and so the relationship between these two scales is a linear one rather than a proportional one $\left( \mathbf { y } = \mathbf { m } \mathbf { x } + \mathbf { b } \right)$ ). Consequently, converting a temperature from one of these scales into the other requires more than simple multiplication by a conversion factor, m, it also must take into account differences in the scales’ zero points (b).

The linear equation relating Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures is easily derived from the two temperatures used to define each scale. Representing the Celsius temperature as $x$ and the Fahrenheit temperature as y, the slope, $m$ , is computed to be:

$$
m = { \frac { \Delta y } { \Delta x } } = { \frac { 2 1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } } { 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } - 0 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } } } = { \frac { 1 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } } { 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } } } = { \frac { 9 { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } } { 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } } }
$$

The y-intercept of the equation, $b$ , is then calculated using either of the equivalent temperature pairs, $( 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { : }$ $2 1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } \ '$ ) or $( 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } , 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ ), as:

$$
b = y - m x = 3 2  ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } - { \frac { 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } } { 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } } } \times 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } = 3 2 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }
$$

The equation relating the temperature $( T )$ scales is then:

$$
T \mathrm { { \circ } _ { F } } = \left( \frac { 9 ~ { \mathrm { { \circ } _ { F } } } } { 5 ~ { \mathrm { { \circ } _ { C } } } } \times T \mathrm { { \circ } _ { C } } \right) + 3 2 ~ { \mathrm { { \circ } _ { F } } }
$$

An abbreviated form of this equation that omits the measurement units is:

$$
T \mathrm { { e } _ { F } } = \left( \frac { 9 } { 5 } \times T \mathrm { { e } _ { C } } \right) + 3 2
$$

Rearrangement of this equation yields the form useful for converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

$$
T _ { ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } } = { \frac { 5 } { 9 } } ( T _ { ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } } - 3 2 )
$$

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the SI unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). Unlike the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, the kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale in which 0 (zero) K corresponds to the lowest temperature that can theoretically be achieved. Since the kelvin temperature scale is absolute, a degree symbol is not included in the unit abbreviation, K. The early 19th-century discovery of the relationship between a gas’s volume and temperature suggested that the volume of a gas would be zero at $- 2 7 3 . 1 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ . In 1848, British physicist William Thompson, who later adopted the title of Lord Kelvin, proposed an absolute temperature scale based on this concept (further treatment of this topic is provided in this text’s chapter on gases).

The freezing temperature of water on this scale is $2 7 3 . 1 5 \mathrm { K }$ and its boiling temperature is 373.15 K. Notice the numerical difference in these two reference temperatures is 100, the same as for the Celsius scale, and so the linear relation between these two temperature scales will exhibit a slope of $\textstyle \frac { \mathrm { K } } { \mathrm { { ^ { c } } } }$ . Following the same approach, the equations for converting between the kelvin and Celsius temperature scales are derived to be:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { T _ { \mathrm { K } } = T _ { \mathrm { ^ C } } + 2 7 3 . 1 5 } \\ { T _ { \mathrm { ^ C } } = T _ { \mathrm { K } } - 2 7 3 . 1 5 } \end{array}
$$

The 273.15 in these equations has been determined experimentally, so it is not exact. Figure 1.28 shows the relationship among the three temperature scales.

Although the kelvin (absolute) temperature scale is the official SI temperature scale, Celsius is commonly used in many scientific contexts and is the scale of choice for nonscience contexts in almost all areas of the world. Very few countries (the U.S. and its territories, the Bahamas, Belize, Cayman Islands, and Palau) still use Fahrenheit for weather, medicine, and cooking.

# EXAMPLE 1.11

# Conversion from Celsius

Normal body temperature has been commonly accepted as $3 7 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ (although it varies depending on time of day and method of measurement, as well as among individuals). What is this temperature on the kelvin scale and on the Fahrenheit scale?

# Solution

$$
\mathrm { K } = { } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } + 2 7 3 . 1 5 = 3 7 . 0 + 2 7 3 . 2 = 3 1 0 . 2 \mathrm { K }
$$

$$
{ } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } = { \frac { 9 } { 5 } } \mathrm { { } ^ { \circ } C } + 3 2 . 0 = { \bigg ( } { \frac { 9 } { 5 } } \times 3 7 . 0 { \bigg ) } + 3 2 . 0 = 6 6 . 6 + 3 2 . 0 = 9 8 . 6 { \mathrm { ~ } } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F }

# Summary

# 1.1 Chemistry in Context

Chemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.

# 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter

Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The basic building block of matter is the atom, the smallest unit of an element that can enter into combinations with atoms of the same or other elements. In many substances, atoms are combined into molecules. On earth, matter commonly exists in three states: solids, of fixed shape and volume; liquids, of variable shape but fixed volume; and gases, of variable shape and volume. Under hightemperature conditions, matter also can exist as a plasma. Most matter is a mixture: It is composed of two or more types of matter that can be present in varying amounts and can be separated by physical means. Heterogeneous mixtures vary in

composition from point to point; homogeneous mixtures have the same composition from point to point. Pure substances consist of only one type of matter. A pure substance can be an element, which consists of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down by a chemical change, or a compound, which consists of two or more types of atoms.

# 1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties

All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand.

Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property.

# 1.4 Measurements

Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and $\mathrm { { g } / \mathrm { { c m } ^ { 3 } } }$ (for density). In many cases, it is convenient to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds ( $\cdot 1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ seconds) and megahertz ( $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ hertz), respectively.



# 1.5 Measurement Uncertainty, Accuracy, and Precision

Quantities can be defined or measured. Measured quantities have an associated uncertainty that is represented by the number of significant figures in the quantity’s number. The uncertainty of a calculated quantity depends on the uncertainties in the quantities used in the calculation and is

reflected in how the value is rounded. Quantities are characterized with regard to accuracy (closeness to a true or accepted value) and precision (variation among replicate measurement results).

# 1.6 Mathematical Treatment of Measurement Results

Measurements are made using a variety of units. It is often useful or necessary to convert a measured quantity from one unit into another. These conversions are accomplished using unit conversion factors, which are derived by simple applications of a mathematical approach called the factor-label method or dimensional analysis. This strategy is also employed to calculate sought quantities using measured quantities and appropriate mathematical relations.
