# 15.2 Lewis Acids and Bases

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the Lewis model of acid-base chemistry • Write equations for the formation of adducts and complex ions • Perform equilibrium calculations involving formation constants

In 1923, G. N. Lewis proposed a generalized definition of acid-base behavior in which acids and bases are identified by their ability to accept or to donate a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond.

A coordinate covalent bond (or dative bond) occurs when one of the atoms in the bond provides both bonding electrons. For example, a coordinate covalent bond occurs when a water molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form a hydronium ion. A coordinate covalent bond also results when an ammonia molecule combines with a hydrogen ion to form an ammonium ion. Both of these equations are shown here.

Reactions involving the formation of coordinate covalent bonds are classified as Lewis acid-base chemistry. The species donating the electron pair that compose the bond is a Lewis base, the species accepting the electron pair is a Lewis acid, and the product of the reaction is a Lewis acid-base adduct. As the two examples above illustrate, Brønsted-Lowry acid-base reactions represent a subcategory of Lewis acid reactions, specifically, those in which the acid species is $\mathrm { H ^ { + } }$ . A few examples involving other Lewis acids and bases are described below.

The boron atom in boron trifluoride, $\mathrm { B F } _ { 3 }$ , has only six electrons in its valence shell. Being short of the preferred octet, $\mathrm { B F } _ { 3 }$ is a very good Lewis acid and reacts with many Lewis bases; a fluoride ion is the Lewis base in this reaction, donating one of its lone pairs:

In the following reaction, each of two ammonia molecules, Lewis bases, donates a pair of electrons to a silver ion, the Lewis acid:

Nonmetal oxides act as Lewis acids and react with oxide ions, Lewis bases, to form oxyanions:

Many Lewis acid-base reactions are displacement reactions in which one Lewis base displaces another Lewis base from an acid-base adduct, or in which one Lewis acid displaces another Lewis acid:

Another type of Lewis acid-base chemistry involves the formation of a complex ion (or a coordination complex) comprising a central atom, typically a transition metal cation, surrounded by ions or molecules called ligands. These ligands can be neutral molecules like $\mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O }$ or $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ , or ions such as $\mathrm { C N ^ { - } o r O H ^ { - } }$ . Often, the ligands act as Lewis bases, donating a pair of electrons to the central atom. These types of Lewis acid-base reactions are examples of a broad subdiscipline called c ordinationchemistry—the topic of another chapter in this text.

The equilibrium constant for the reaction of a metal ion with one or more ligands to form a coordination complex is called a formation constant $( K _ { \mathrm { f } } )$ (sometimes called a stability constant). For example, the complex ion $\mathrm { C u ( C N ) } _ { 2 } -$

$$
[ : N \equiv \texttt { c - c u - c } \equiv \texttt { N } ] ^ { - }
$$

is produced by the reaction

$$
\mathbf { C } \mathbf { u } ^ { + } ( a q ) + 2 \mathbf { C } \mathbf { N } ^ { - } ( a q )  \mathbf { C } \mathbf { u } ( \mathbf { C } \mathbf { N } ) _ { 2 } ^ { - } ( a q )
$$

The formation constant for this reaction is

$$
K _ { \mathrm { f } } = { \frac { \left[ \mathrm { C u } ( \mathrm { C N } ) _ { 2 } { } ^ { - } \right] } { \left[ \mathrm { C u } ^ { + } \right] \left[ \mathrm { C N } ^ { - } \right] ^ { 2 } } }
$$

Alternatively, the reverse reaction (decomposition of the complex ion) can be considered, in which case the equilibrium constant is a dissociation constant $( K _ { \mathbf { d } } )$ . Per the relation between equilibrium constants for reciprocal reactions described, the dissociation constant is the mathematical inverse of the formation constant, $K _ { d } = \mathrm { K _ { f } } ^ { - 1 }$ . A tabulation of formation constants is provided in Appendix K.

As an example of dissolution by complex ion formation, let us consider what happens when we add aqueous ammonia to a mixture of silver chloride and water. Silver chloride dissolves slightly in water, giving a small concentration of $\operatorname { A g } ^ { + } \left( \operatorname { \ I A g } ^ { + } \right] = 1 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } ~ M )$ :

$$
\operatorname { A g C l } ( s )  \operatorname { A g } ^ { + } ( a q ) + \operatorname { C l } ^ { - } ( a q )
$$

However, if $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ is present in the water, the complex ion, $\mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } { ^ + }$ can form according to the equation:

$$
\mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ( a q ) + 2 \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ( a q )  \mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ^ { + } ( a q )
$$

with

$$
K _ { \mathrm { f } } = { \frac { \mathrm { [ A g ( N H _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ^ { + } ] } } { \mathrm { [ A g ^ { + } ] [ N H _ { 3 } ] ^ { 2 } } } } = 1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 }
$$

The large size of this formation constant indicates that most of the free silver ions produced by the dissolution of $\tt A g C l$ combine with $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ to form $\mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } { } ^ { + }$ As a consequence, the concentration of silver ions, $[ \mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ] ,$ is reduced, and the reaction quotient for the dissolution of silver chloride, $[ \mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ] [ \mathrm { C l } ^ { - } ]$ , falls below the solubility

product of AgCl:

$$
Q = [ \mathrm { A g ^ { + } } ] \left[ \mathrm { C l ^ { - } } \right] < K _ { \mathrm { s p } }
$$

More silver chloride then dissolves. If the concentration of ammonia is great enough, all of the silver chloride dissolves.

# EXAMPLE 15.14

# Dissociation of a Complex Ion

Calculate the concentration of the silver ion in a solution that initially is $0 . 1 0 M$ with respect to $\mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } +$

# Solution

Applying the standard ICE approach to this reaction yields the following:

Substituting these equilibrium concentration terms into the $K _ { \mathrm { f } }$ expression gives

$$
K _ { \mathrm { f } } = { \frac { [ \mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } + ] } { [ \mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ] [ \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ] ^ { 2 } } }
$$

$$
1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 } = \frac { 0 . 1 0 - x } { ( x ) ( 2 x ) ^ { 2 } }
$$

The very large equilibrium constant means the amount of the complex ion that will dissociate, $X _ { i }$ , will be very small. Assuming $X < < 0 . 1$ permits simplifying the above equation:

$$
1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 } = \frac { 0 . 1 0 } { ( x ) ( 2 x ) ^ { 2 } }
$$

$$
x ^ { 3 } = \frac { 0 . 1 0 } { 4 ( 1 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { 7 } ) } = 1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 9 }
$$

$$
x = \sqrt [ 3 ] { 1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 9 } } = 1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }
$$

Because only $1 . 1 \%$ of the $\mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } +$ dissociates into ${ \mathrm { A g } } ^ { + }$ and $\mathrm { N H } _ { 3 }$ , the assumption that $x$ is small is justified.

Using this value of $\boldsymbol { x }$ and the relations in the above ICE table allows calculation of all species’ equilibrium concentrations:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { [ \mathrm { A g } ^ { + } ] ~ = ~ 0 + x = 1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ M } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { [ \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ] = 0 + 2 x = 2 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ M } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { [ \mathrm { A g } ( \mathrm { N H } _ { 3 } ) _ { 2 } ^ { + } ] = 0 . 1 0 - x = 0 . 1 0 - 0 . 0 0 1 1 = 0 . 0 9 9 } } \end{array}
$$

The concentration of free silver ion in the solution is 0.0011 M.
