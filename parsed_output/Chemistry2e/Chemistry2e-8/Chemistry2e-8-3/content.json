Thus we expect the \u03c3 bonds from each carbon atom are formed using a set of $\\scriptstyle s p ^ { 2 }$ hybrid orbitals that result from hybridization of two of the $2 p$ orbitals and the 2sorbital (Figure 8.22). These orbitals form the $\\mathrm { C - H }$ single bonds and the $\\sigma$ bond in the $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } } = \\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { C } }$ double bond (Figure 8.23).The \u03c0 bond in the $\\mathrm { C } = \\mathrm { C }$ double bond results from the overlap of the third (remaining) $2 p$ orbital on each carbon atom that is not involved in hybridization. This unhybridized $p$ orbital (lobes shown in red and blue in Figure 8.23) is perpendicular to the plane of the $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybrid orbitals. Thus the unhybridized $2 p$ orbitals overlap in a side-by-side fashion, above and below the internuclear axis (Figure 8.23) and form a \u03c0 bond. ",

If the two planes of $\\scriptstyle s p ^ { 2 }$ hybrid orbitals tilted relative to each other, the $p$ orbitals would not be oriented to overlap efficiently to create the \u03c0 bond. The planar configuration for the ethene molecule occurs because it is the most stable bonding arrangement. This is a significant difference between \u03c3 and \u03c0 bonds; rotation around single (\u03c3) bonds occurs easily because the end-to-end orbital overlap does not depend on the relative orientation of the orbitals on each atom in the bond. In other words, rotation around the internuclear axis does not change the extent to which the \u03c3 bonding orbitals overlap because the bonding electron density is symmetric about the axis. Rotation about the internuclear axis is much more difficult for multiple bonds; however, this would drastically alter the off-axis overlap of the \u03c0 bonding orbitals, essentially breaking the \u03c0 bond.

The sphybrid orbitals of the two carbon atoms overlap end to end to form a \u03c3 bond between the carbon atoms (Figure 8.25). The remaining sporbitals form \u03c3 bonds with hydrogen atoms. The two unhybridized $p$ orbitals per carbon are positioned such that they overlap side by side and, hence, form two \u03c0 bonds. The two carbon atoms of acetylene are thus bound together by one \u03c3 bond and two \u03c0 bonds, giving a triple bond. ",
