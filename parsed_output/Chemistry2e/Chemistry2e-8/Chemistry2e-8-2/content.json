However, to understand how molecules with more than two atoms form stable bonds, we require a more detailed model. As an example, let us consider the water molecule, in which we have one oxygen atom bonding to two hydrogen atoms. Oxygen has the electron configuration $1 s ^ { 2 } 2 s ^ { 2 } 2 p ^ { 4 }$ , with two unpaired electrons (one in each of the two $2 p$ orbitals). Valence bond theory would predict that the two $_ { \\mathrm { O - H } }$ bonds form from the overlap of these two $2 p$ orbitals with the 1sorbitals of the hydrogen atoms. If this were the case, the bond angle would be $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , as shown in Figure $\\underline { { 8 . 6 } }$ , because $p$ orbitals are perpendicular to each other. Experimental evidence shows that the bond angle is $1 0 4 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , not $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The prediction of the valence bond theory model does not match the real-world observations of a water molecule; a different model is needed. ",

The mathematical expression known as the wave function, $\\psi$ , contains information about each orbital and the wavelike properties of electrons in an isolated atom. When atoms are bound together in a molecule, the wave functions combine to produce new mathematical descriptions that have different shapes. This process of combining the wave functions for atomic orbitals is called hybridization and is mathematically accomplished by the linearcombinationofatomicorbitals, LCAO, (a technique that we will encounter again later). The new orbitals that result are called hybrid orbitals. The valence orbitals in an isolatedoxygen atom are a $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals. The valence orbitals in an oxygen atom in a water molecule differ; they consist of four equivalent hybrid orbitals that point approximately toward the corners of a tetrahedron (Figure 8.7). Consequently, the overlap of the O and H orbitals should result in a tetrahedral bond angle $( 1 0 9 . 5 ^ { \\circ } )$ . The observed angle of $1 0 4 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ is experimental evidence for which quantum-mechanical calculations give a useful explanation: Valence bond theory must include a hybridization component to give accurate predictions.

        "text": "It is important to remember that hybridization was devised to rationalize experimentally observed molecular geometries. The model works well for molecules containing small central atoms, in which the valence electron pairs are close together in space. However, for larger central atoms, the valence-shell electron pairs are farther from the nucleus, and there are fewer repulsions. Their compounds exhibit structures that are often not consistent with VSEPR theory, and hybridized orbitals are not necessary to explain the observed data. For example, we have discussed the $_ \\mathrm { H - O - H }$ bond angle in $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } O }$ , $1 0 4 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , which is more consistent with $s p ^ { 3 }$ hybrid orbitals $( 1 0 9 . 5 ^ { \\circ } )$ on the central atom than with $2 p$ orbitals $( 9 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ . Sulfur is in the same group as oxygen, and $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } S }$ has a similar Lewis structure. However, it has a much smaller bond angle $( 9 2 . 1 ^ { \\circ } )$ , which indicates much less hybridization on sulfur than oxygen. Continuing down the group, tellurium is even larger than sulfur, and for $\\mathrm { H _ { 2 } T e }$ , the observed bond angle $( 9 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ is consistent with overlap of the $5 p$ orbitals, without invoking hybridization. We invoke hybridization where it is necessary to explain the observed structures. ",
