        "text": "INTRODUCTION Liquid water is essential to life on our planet, and chemistry involving the characteristic ions of water, $\\mathrm { H ^ { + } }$ and $\\mathrm { O H ^ { - } }$ , is widely encountered in nature and society. As introduced in another chapter of this text, acid-base chemistry involves the transfer of hydrogen ions from donors (acids) to acceptors (bases). These $\\mathrm { H } +$ transfer reactions are reversible, and the equilibria established by acid-base systems are essential aspects of phenomena ranging from sinkhole formation (Figure 14.1) to oxygen transport in the human body. This chapter will further explore acid-base chemistry with an emphasis on the equilibrium aspects of this important reaction class. ",
