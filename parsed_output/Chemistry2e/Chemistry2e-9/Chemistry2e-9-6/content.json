This behavior is reflected by the \u201cdips\u201d in several of the compressibility curves shown in Figure 9.35. The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with increasing $P ,$ ).

(c) What is the effect of the volume of gas molecules on Z? Under what conditions is this effect small? When is it large? Explain using an appropriate diagram.   \n(d) What is the effect of intermolecular attractions on the value of Z? Under what conditions is this effect small? When is it large? Explain using an appropriate diagram.   \n(e) In general, under what temperature conditions would you expect Z to have the largest deviations from the Z for an ideal gas? ",
