# 9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior   
• Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation   
• Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior   
• Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the van der Waals equation

Thus far, the ideal gas law, $P V = n R T _ { ; }$ , has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from reaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.



One way in which the accuracy of $P V = n R T$ can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, $V _ { \mathrm { m } } )$ to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor $\mathbf { \delta } ( \mathbf { Z } )$ with:

$$
{ \mathrm { Z } } = { \frac { \mathrm { \ m o l a r ~ v o l u m e ~ o f ~ g a s ~ a t ~ s a m e } T \mathrm { ~ a n d } P } { \mathrm { ~ m o l a r ~ v o l u m e ~ o f ~ i d e a l ~ g a s ~ a t ~ s a m e } T \mathrm { ~ a n d } P } } = \left( { \frac { P V _ { m } } { R T } } \right) _ { \mathrm { \Omega } }
$$

Ideal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1, and any deviation from 1 is an indication of non-ideal behavior. Figure 9.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.

As is apparent from Figure 9.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.

Particles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportionalas predicted by Boyle’s law.

At relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (Figure 9.36). This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another.

There are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law. The first, and simplest, of these was developed by the Dutch scientist Johannes van der Waals in 1879. The van der Waals equation improves upon the ideal gas law by adding two terms: one to account for the volume of the gas molecules and another for the attractive forces between them.

The constant acorresponds to the strength of the attraction between molecules of a particular gas, and the constant $b$ corresponds to the size of the molecules of a particular gas. The “correction” to the pressure term in the ideal gas law i s and the “correction” to the volume is nb. Note that when Vis relatively large and nis relatively small, both of these correction terms become negligible, and the van der Waals equation reduces to the ideal gas law, $P V = n R T$ . Such a condition corresponds to a gas in which a relatively low number of molecules is occupying a relatively large volume, that is, a gas at a relatively low pressure. Experimental values for the van der Waals constants of some common gases are given in Table 9.3.

At low pressures, the correction for intermolecular attraction, a, is more important than the one for molecular volume, $b _ { \scriptscriptstyle { \it \ / { M N } } }$ . At high pressures and small volumes, the correction for the volume of the molecules becomes important because the molecules themselves are incompressible and constitute an appreciable fraction of the total volume. At some intermediate pressure, the two corrections have opposing influences and the gas appears to follow the relationship given by $P V = n R T$ over a small range of pressures. This behavior is reflected by the “dips” in several of the compressibility curves shown in Figure 9.35. The attractive force between molecules initially makes the gas more compressible than an ideal gas, as pressure is raised (Z decreases with increasing $P ,$ ). At very high pressures, the gas becomes less compressible (Z increases with $P _ {  }$ ), as the gas molecules begin to occupy an increasingly significant fraction of the total gas volume.

Strictly speaking, the ideal gas equation functions well when intermolecular attractions between gas molecules are negligible and the gas molecules themselves do not occupy an appreciable part of the whole volume. These criteria are satisfied under conditions of lowpres ureandhightemperature. Under such conditions, the gas is said to behave ideally, and deviations from the gas laws are small enough that they may be disregarded—this is, however, very often not the case.

# EXAMPLE 9.24

# Comparison of Ideal Gas Law and van der Waals Equation

A 4.25-L flask contains $3 . 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m o l } ~ \mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ at $2 2 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } .$ . Calculate the pressure of this sample of $\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$

(a) from the ideal gas law (b) from the van der Waals equation (c) Explain the reason(s) for the difference.

# Solution

(a) From the ideal gas law:

$$
P = { \frac { n R T } { V } } = { \frac { 3 . 4 6 \cdot { \mathrm { m e l } } \times 0 . 0 8 2 0 6 \pm { \mathrm { a t m } } { \overline { { { \mathrm { m o l } } } } } ^ { - 1 } - \kappa ^ { - 1 } \times 5 0 2 \cdot { \mathrm { K } } } { 4 . 2 5 \pm } } = 3 3 . 5 \tan { \frac { N } { { \mathrm { m o l } } } \cdot { \mathrm { K } } } 
$$

(b) From the van der Waals equation:

$$
\left( P + { \frac { n ^ { 2 } a } { V ^ { 2 } } } \right) \times ( V - n b ) = n R T \longrightarrow P = { \frac { n R T } { ( V - n b ) } } - { \frac { n ^ { 2 } a } { V ^ { 2 } } }
$$

$$
P = { \frac { 3 . 4 6 { \mathrm { m o l } } \times 0 . 0 8 2 0 6 { \mathrm { L a t m m o l } } ^ { - 1 } { \mathrm { K } } ^ { - 1 } \times 5 0 2 { \mathrm { K } } } { \left( 4 . 2 5 { \mathrm { L } } - 3 . 4 6 { \mathrm { m o l } } \times 0 . 0 4 2 7 { \mathrm { L } } { \mathrm { m o l } } ^ { - 1 } \right) } } - { \frac { ( 3 . 4 6 { \mathrm { m o l } } ) ^ { 2 } \times 3 . 5 9 { \mathrm { L } } ^ { 2 } { \mathrm { a t m m o l } } ^ { 2 } } { ( 4 . 2 5 { \mathrm { L } } ) ^ { 2 } } }
$$

This finally yields $P = 3 2 . 4 \$ atm.

(c) This is not very different from the value from the ideal gas law because the pressure is not very high and the temperature is not very low. The value is somewhat different because $\mathrm { C O } _ { 2 }$ molecules do have some volume and attractions between molecules, and the ideal gas law assumes they do not have volume or attractions.

# Summary

# 9.1 Gas Pressure

Gases exert pressure, which is force per unit area. The pressure of a gas may be expressed in the SI unit of pascal or kilopascal, as well as in many other units including torr, atmosphere, and bar. Atmospheric pressure is measured using a barometer; other gas pressures can be measured using one of several types of manometers.

# 9.2 Relating Pressure, Volume, Amount, and Temperature: The Ideal Gas Law

The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle’s law). Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro’s law).

The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, $P V = n R T$ , where $P$ is the pressure of the gas, $V$ is its volume, $\boldsymbol { n }$ is the number of moles of the gas, $T$ is its kelvin temperature, and $R$ is the ideal (universal) gas constant.

# 9.3 Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions

The ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of convenient equations relating directly measured

quantities to properties of interest for gaseous substances and mixtures. Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s law may be used in stoichiometric computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products.

# 9.4 Effusion and Diffusion of Gases

Gaseous atoms and molecules move freely and randomly through space. Diffusion is the process whereby gaseous atoms and molecules are transferred from regions of relatively high concentration to regions of relatively low concentration. Effusion is a similar process in which gaseous species pass from a container to a vacuum through very small orifices. The rates of effusion of gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities or to the square roots of their atoms/molecules’ masses (Graham’s law).

# 9.5 The Kinetic-Molecular Theory

The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The theory assumes that gases consist of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion, colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with average speeds determined by their absolute temperatures. The individual molecules of a gas exhibit a range of speeds, the distribution of these speeds being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its molecules.



# 9.6 Non-Ideal Gas Behavior

Gas molecules possess a finite volume and experience forces of attraction for one another. Consequently, gas behavior is not necessarily described well by the ideal gas law. Under conditions of low pressure and high temperature, these factors are negligible, the ideal gas equation is an accurate description of gas behavior, and the gas is said to exhibit ideal behavior. However, at lower temperatures and higher pressures, corrections for molecular volume and molecular attractions are required to account for finite molecular size and attractive forces. The van der Waals equation is a modified version of the ideal gas law that can be used to account for the non-ideal behavior of gases under these conditions.
