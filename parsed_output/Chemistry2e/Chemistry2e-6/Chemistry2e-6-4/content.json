In any atom with two or more electrons, the repulsion between the electrons makes energies of subshells with different values of $\\boldsymbol { l }$ differ so that the energy of the orbitals increases within a shell in the order $s < p < d < f .$ Figure 6.24 depicts how these two trends in increasing energy relate. The $1 s$ orbital at the bottom of the diagram is the orbital with electrons of lowest energy. The energy increases as we move up to the $2 s$ and then $2 p , 3 s ,$ and $3 p$ orbitals, showing that the increasing $n$ value has more influence on energy than the increasing lvalue for small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The $3 d$ orbital is higher in energy than the $4 s$ orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move up the chart. ",

        "text": "Electrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d ,$ , and immediately before the 6s. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $\\boldsymbol { n }$ , increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of lincreases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s > p > d > f .$ Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron\u2013nucleus attractions slightly (recall that all electrons have $^ { - 1 }$ charges, but nuclei have $+ Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals (1sthrough $3 p \\mathrm { . }$ ), the increase in energy due to $\\boldsymbol { n }$ is more significant than the increase due to $I ;$ however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order. ",

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau(\u201cto build up\u201d). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 6.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 6.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 6.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be 4s (K, Ca), followed by the $3 d$ orbitals. ",

However, we do find exceptions to the order of filling of orbitals that are shown in Figure 6.26 or Figure 6.27. For instance, the electron configurations (shown in Figure 6.29) of the transition metals chromium (Cr; atomic number 24) and copper (Cu; atomic number 29), among others, are not those we would expect. In general, such exceptions involve subshells with very similar energy, and small effects can lead to changes in the order of filling. ",

This stability is such that an electron shifts from the $4 s$ into the $3 d$ orbital to gain the extra stability of a half-filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cr) or a filled $3 d$ subshell (in Cu). Other exceptions also occur. For example, niobium (Nb, atomic number 41) is predicted to have the electron configuration $[ \\mathrm { K r } ] 5 s ^ { 2 } 4 d ^ { 3 }$ . Experimentally, we observe that its ground-state electron configuration is actually $[ \\mathrm { K r } ] 5 s ^ { 1 } 4 d ^ { 4 }$ . We can rationalize this observation by saying that the electron\u2013electron repulsions experienced by pairing the electrons in the $5 s$ orbital are larger than the gap in energy between the $5 s$ and $4 d$ orbitals. There is no simple method to predict the exceptions for atoms where the magnitude of the repulsions between electrons is greater than the small differences in energy between subshells. ",

When their electron configurations are added to the table (Figure 6.29), we also see a periodic recurrence of similar electron configurations in the outer shells of these elements. Because they are in the outer shells of an atom, valence electrons play the most important role in chemical reactions. The outer electrons have the highest energy of the electrons in an atom and are more easily lost or shared than the core electrons.

This arrangement is emphasized in Figure 6.29, which shows in periodic-table form the electron configuration of the last subshell to be filled by the Aufbau principle.

Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added enters an sor a $p$ orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 6.29. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest $n$ level. For example, gallium (Ga, atomic number 31) has the electron configuration $[ \\mathrm { A r } ] \\underline { { { 4 s ^ { 2 } } } } 3 d ^ { 1 0 } \\underline { { { 4 p ^ { 1 } } } }$ , which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled $d$ orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.   \n2. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added enters a $d$ orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the nsand $( n - 1 )$ delectrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled $d$ orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg, as well as Cu, Ag, and Au in Figure 6.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire $d$ block (colored yellow in Figure 6.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.   \n3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an forbital. They are shown in green in Figure 6.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the $( n - 2 ) f ,$ the $( n - 1 ) d$ , and the nssubshells. There are two inner transition series: a. The lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu) b. The actinide series: actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr) ",
