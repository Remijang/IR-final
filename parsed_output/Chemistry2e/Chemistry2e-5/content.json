        "text": "INTRODUCTION Chemical reactions, such as those that occur when you light a match, involve changes in energy as well as matter. Societies at all levels of development could not function without the energy released by chemical reactions. In 2012, about $8 5 \\%$ of US energy consumption came from the combustion of petroleum products, coal, wood, and garbage. We use this energy to produce electricity $( 3 8 \\% )$ ; to transport food, raw materials, manufactured goods, and people $( 2 7 \\% )$ ; for industrial production $( 2 1 \\% )$ ; and to heat and power our homes and businesses $( 1 0 \\% )$ .1 While these combustion reactions help us meet our essential energy needs, they are also recognized by the majority of the scientific community as a major contributor to global climate change.

For example, the energy produced by the batteries in a cell phone, car, or flashlight results from chemical reactions. This chapter introduces many of the basic ideas necessary to explore the relationships between chemical changes and energy, with a focus on thermal energy. ",
