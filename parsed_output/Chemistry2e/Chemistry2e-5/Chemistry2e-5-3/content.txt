Thermochemistry is a branch of chemical thermodynamics, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.

Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the internal energy (U), sometimes symbolized as  .

As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat  from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (w) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire’s temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.

The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:

as shown in Figure 5.19. This is one version of the first law of thermodynamics, and it shows that the internal energy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive  is heat flow in; negative  is heat flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, w, is positive if it is done on the system and negative if it is done by the system.

A type of work called expansion work (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine. The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder. The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine is running.) We will consider how to determine the amount of work involved in a chemical or physical change in the chapter on thermodynamics.

This view of an internal combustion engine (http://openstax.org/l/16combustion) illustrates the conversion of energy produced by the exothermic combustion reaction of a fuel such as gasoline into energy of motion.

As discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as  . Internal energy is an example of a state function (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value doesdepend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of  , and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path (Figure 5.20). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).

Chemists ordinarily use a property known as enthalpy  to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system’s internal energy  and the mathematical product of its pressure  and volume  :

Enthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only enthalpy changesfor chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical changes), the enthalpy change  is:

The mathematical product  represents work (w), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By their definitions, the arithmetic signs of  and wwill always be opposite:

Substituting this equation and the definition of internal energy into the enthalpy-change equation yields:

where  is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.

And so, if a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow  and enthalpy change  for the process are equal.

The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter (Figure 5.17) is not equal to  because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents the pressure from remaining constant (it may increase or decrease if the reaction yields increased or decreased amounts of gaseous species). Chemists usually perform experiments under normal atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure with   which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for determining heat changes for chemical reactions.

The following conventions apply when using 

• A negative value of an enthalpy change,  , indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value,  , indicates an endothermic reaction. If the direction of a chemical equation is reversed, the arithmetic sign of its  is changed (a process that is endothermic in one direction is exothermic in the opposite direction).   
• Chemists use a thermochemical equation to represent the changes in both matter and energy. In a thermochemical equation, the enthalpy change of a reaction is shown as a  value following the equation for the reaction. This  value indicates the amount of heat associated with the reaction involving the number of moles of reactants and products asshowninthechemicalequation. For example, consider this equation:

This equation indicates that when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and  mole of oxygen gas at some temperature and pressure change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure,  of heat are released to the surroundings. If the coefficients of the chemical equation are multiplied by some factor, the enthalpy change must be multiplied by that same factor (  is an extensive property):

• The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the physical states of the reactants and products, so these must be shown. For example, when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and  mole of oxygen gas change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure,  of heat are released. If gaseous water forms, only  of heat are released.

EXAMPLE 5.8

Writing Thermochemical Equations

Solution

For the reaction of  acid (HCl),  . The reactants are provided in stoichiometric amounts (same molar ratio as in the balanced equation), and so the amount of acid may be used to calculate a molar enthalpy change. Since  is an extensive property, it is proportional to the amount of acid neutralized:

EXAMPLE 5.9

Writing Thermochemical Equations

A gummy bear contains  sucrose,  . When it reacts with  potassium chlorate,  , 43.7  of heat are produced. Write a thermochemical equation for the reaction of one mole of sucrose:

Solution

Unlike the previous example exercise, this one does not involve the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of reactants, and so the limitingreactantmust be identified (it limits the yield of the reaction and the amount of thermal energy produced or consumed).

The provided amounts of the two reactants are

The provided molar ratio of perchlorate-to-sucrose is then

The balanced equation indicates 8 mol  are required for reaction with 1 mol  . Since the provided amount of  is less than the stoichiometric amount, it is the limiting reactant and may be used to compute the enthalpy change:

Because the equation, as written, represents the reaction of  , the enthalpy change is

The enthalpy change for this reaction is  , and the thermochemical equation is:

When  of iron reacts with  of chlorine,  of  and  of heat is produced. What is the enthalpy change for the reaction when 1 mole of  is produced?

Answer: 

Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at  , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the  of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure  atm),  values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted “o” in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is  , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol  is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol  is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)

The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensivenature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the  for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property  by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of  often “normalized” to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)

Standard Enthalpy of Combustion

Standard enthalpy of combustion  is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of combustion.” For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol,  , is the amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at  and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at  and 1 atm.

Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are listed in Table 5.2. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and hydrocarbons (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane, and the major components of gasoline.

EXAMPLE 5.10

Using Enthalpy of Combustion

As Figure 5.21 suggests, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning  of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692  .

Solution

Starting with a known amount  of isooctane), we can perform conversions between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy of combustion of isooctane provides one of the

necessary conversions. Table 5.2 gives this value as  per 1 mole of isooctane  . Using these data,

1.00 LCgI  × 104kJ The combustion of  of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to melt  , or about 218 lbs, of ice.)

Emerging Algae-Based Energy Technologies (Biofuels)

As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae (Figure 5.22). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms. About  of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of biofuel per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline, ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.

According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about  of the land mass of the US or less than  of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleum-based fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under  5\mathrm { C O _ { 2 } }$ as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute (Figure 5.23).

Standard Enthalpy of Formation

A standard enthalpy of formation  is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess’s law.

The standard enthalpy of formation of  is  . This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction:

starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and  (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of  , also at 1 atm and  . For nitrogen dioxide,  is  . This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

A reaction equation with  mole of  and 1 mole of  is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole of product,  .

You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in Appendix G. These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as  for the formation of  ) to strongly endothermic (such as  for the formation of acetylene,  . By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under

standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions.

Ozone,  , forms from oxygen,  , by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere.

Answer:

Hess’s Law

There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.

This type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess’s law, which states: Ifaproces canbewritenasthe sumofseveralstepwiseproces es,theenthalpychangeofthetotalproces equalsthesumoftheenthalpy changesofthevarioussteps. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written:

In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:

Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:

The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:

Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:

According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.

The result is shown in Figure 5.24. We see that  of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall  for the reaction  sum of  values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes.

Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of  .

1.  is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of  is  :

When 2 moles of  (twice as much) are formed, the  will be twice as large:

In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be multiplied or divided by the same number.

2. ΔHfor a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to  for the reaction in the reverse direction. For example, given that:

Then, for the “reverse” reaction, the enthalpy change is also “reversed”:

EXAMPLE 5.13

Stepwise Calculation of  Using Hess’s Law

Determine the enthalpy of formation,  of  from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process that occurs under standard state conditions:

Solution

We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of  , which is equal to  for the reaction:

Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find  is the sum of the two reactions with known  values, so we must sum their  :

Here is a less straightforward example that illustrates the thought process involved in solving many Hess’s law problems. It shows how we can find many standard enthalpies of formation (and other values of  if they are difficult to determine experimentally.

EXAMPLE 5.14

A More Challenging Problem Using Hess’s Law

Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:

Use the reactions here to determine the  for reaction  :

Solution

Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions (i), (ii), and (iv)such that they add up to reaction  . Going from left to right in  , we first see that  is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction (ii)by  which means that the  change is also multiplied by 

Next, we see that  is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction  , which means that the  changes sign and is halved:

To get  as a product, reverse (iv), changing the sign of  :

Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

Reactants  and  cancel out product  ; product  cancels reactant  and reactant  is cancelled by products  and  . This leaves only reactants  and  and product  , which are what we want. Since summing these three modified reactions yields the reaction of interest, summing the three modified  values will give the desired  :

Answer: −1407 kJ

We also can use Hess’s law to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with  representing “the sum of” and  standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:

The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.

EXAMPLE 5.15

Using Hess’s Law

What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:

Solution: Using the Equation

Use the special form of Hess’s law given previously, and values from Appendix G:

Solution: Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid

Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of  and  into their constituent elements, and the formation of  and  from their constituent elements. Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the  values for these compounds (from Appendix G ), we have:

Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in:

Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:

So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is  .

Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the  of each product by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the  of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.

Key Equations

Summary

5.1 Energy Basics

Energy is the capacity to supply heat or do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position, composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of thermodynamics).

The thermal energy of matter is due to the kinetic energies of its constituent atoms or molecules. Temperature is an intensive property of matter reflecting hotness or coldness that increases as the average kinetic energy increases. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures. Chemical and physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).

Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature change it undergoes.

5.2 Calorimetry

Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the process using known mathematical relations.

Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between their contents and the external environment. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the energy content of food.

5.3 Enthalpy

If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction,  for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol  or  for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at  . The value of  for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to  for the reaction in the opposite direction, and  is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation,  is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and  . If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.
