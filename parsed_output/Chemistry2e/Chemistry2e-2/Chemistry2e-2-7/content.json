The simplest of these are binary compounds, those containing only two elements, but we will also consider how to name ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions, and one specific, very important class of compounds known as acids (subsequent chapters in this text will focus on these compounds in great detail). We will limit our attention here to inorganic compounds, compounds that are composed principally of elements other than carbon, and will follow the nomenclature guidelines proposed by IUPAC. The rules for organic compounds, in which carbon is the principle element, will be treated in a later chapter on organic chemistry. ",

        "text": "Chemists use nomenclature rules to clearly name compounds. Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a nonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to \u2013ide. For example, $\\mathrm { K _ { 2 } O }$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 2 }$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm { F e C l } _ { 3 }$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include ${ \\mathrm { S F } } _ { 6 }$ , sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { O } _ { 4 }$ , dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the \u2013idesuffix to \u2013ic, and adding \u201cacid;\u201d HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (\u2013ateto \u2013icand \u2013iteto \u2013ous), and adding \u201cacid;\u201d $\\mathrm { { H _ { 2 } C O _ { 3 } } }$ is carbonic acid. ",
