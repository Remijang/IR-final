7.9 World Energy Use

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Describe the distinction between renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. • Explain why the inevitable conversion of energy to less useful forms makes it necessary to conserve energy resources.

Energy is an important ingredient in all phases of society. We live in a very interdependent world, and access to adequate and reliable energy resources is crucial for economic growth and for maintaining the quality of our lives. But current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. Depending on the data source, estimates indicate that about  of the world’s energy comes from oil, and much of that goes to transportation uses. This is a reduction by a few percentage points from ten years ago. Oil prices are dependent as much upon new (or foreseen) discoveries as they are upon political events and situations around the world. The U.S., with  of the world’s population, consumes  of the world’s oil production per year.

Renewable and Nonrenewable Energy Sources

The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in Figure 7.26. The fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. Renewable forms of energy are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar, and biomass. About  of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy.

The World’s Growing Energy Needs

World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing countries. (See Figure 7.27.) Global demand for energy has tripled in the past 50 years and might triple again in the next 30 years. While much of this growth will come from the rapidly booming economies of China and India, many of the developed countries, especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet their energy needs by expanding the use of renewable sources. Although presently only a small percentage, renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind energy. For example, Germany plans to meet  of its power and  of its overall energy needs with renewable resources by the year 2030. (See Figure 7.28.) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid economic growth of China and India. In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest consumer of oil. However, over  of this is imported. Unlike most Western countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of China, accounting for  of its energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the United States as the largest generator of  . In India, the main energy resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil is imported. About  of India’s

electricity is generated by highly polluting coal. Yet there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India has a rapidly growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program in the world. China has invested substantially in building solar collection farms as well as hydroelectric plants.

Table 7.6 displays the 2020 commercial energy mix by country for some of the prime energy users in the world. While non-renewable sources dominate, some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity from renewable resources. For example, about two-thirds of New Zealand’s electricity demand is met by hydroelectric. Only  of the U.S. electricity is generated by renewable resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to determine total sources and consumers of energy in many countries, and estimates vary somewhat by data source and type of measurement.

Energy and Economic Well-being

Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is borne out in Figure 7.29. Increased efficiency of energy use will change this dependency. A global problem is balancing energy resource development against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction and use.

New and diversified energy sources do, however, greatly increase economic opportunity and stability. First, the extensive employment opportunities in renewable energy make it one of the most sustainable and secure fields to enter. Second, renewable energy provides countries and localities with increased levels of resiliency in the face of natural disasters, conflict, or other disruptions. The 21st century has already seen major economic impacts from energy disruptions: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, various wildfires, Hurricane Maria, and the 2021 Texas Winter Storm demonstrate the vulnerability of United States power systems. Diversifying energy sources through renewables and other fossil-fuel alternatives brings power grids and transportation systems back online much more quickly, saving lives and enabling a more swift return to economic operations. And as critical emerging information infrastructure, such as data centers, requires more of the world's energy, supplying those growing systems during normal operations and crises will be increasingly important.

Conserving Energy

As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some distinctions between two sometimes misunderstood terms in the area of energy use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of energy” is a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that cannot be proven from basic principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device, and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important philosophy of energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g., turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task—such as developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc.

Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one might wonder why we need to be concerned about our energy resources, since energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion to energy forms no longer useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation. (This will be discussed in more detail in Thermodynamics.)

Section Summary

7.1 Work: The Scientific Definition

• Work is the transfer of energy by a force acting on an object as it is displaced.   
• The work  that a force  does on an object is the product of the magnitude  of the force, times the magnitude  of the displacement, times the cosine of the angle  between them. In symbols,    
The SI unit for work and energy is the joule (J), where  .   
• The work done by a force is zero if the displacement is either zero or perpendicular to the force.   
• The work done is positive if the force and displacement have the same direction, and negative if they have opposite direction.

7.2 Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem

• The net work  is the work done by the net

force acting on an object.   
• Work done on an object transfers energy to the object.   
The translational kinetic energy of an object of mass moving at speed  is  .   
The work-energy theorem states that the net work  on a system changes its kinetic energy,  .

7.3 Gravitational Potential Energy

• Work done against gravity in lifting an object becomes potential energy of the object-Earth system.   
• The change in gravitational potential energy,  , is  , with  being the increase in height and the acceleration due to gravity.   
The gravitational potential energy of an object near Earth’s surface is due to its position in the massEarth system. Only differences in gravitational potential energy,  , have physical significance.   
• As an object descends without friction, its gravitational potential energy changes into kinetic energy corresponding to increasing speed, so that △KE=-△PEg.

7.4 Conservative Forces and Potential Energy

• A conservative force is one for which work depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion, not on the path taken.   
• We can define potential energy for any conservative force, just as we defined  for the gravitational force.   
• The potential energy of a spring is  , where  is the spring’s force constant and  is the displacement from its undeformed position.   
• Mechanical energy is defined to be  for a conservative force.   
• When only conservative forces act on and within a system, the total mechanical energy is constant. In equation form,   
• Friction is an example of a nonconservative force that changes mechanical energy into thermal energy.   
• Work  done by a nonconservative force changes the mechanical energy of a system. In equation form,  or, equivalently,  .   
• When both conservative and nonconservative forces act, energy conservation can be applied and used to calculate motion in terms of the known potential energies of the conservative forces and the work done by nonconservative forces, instead of finding the net work from the net force, or having to directly apply Newton’s laws.

7.6 Conservation of Energy

• The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy is constant in any process. Energy may change in form or be transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same.   
• When all forms of energy are considered, conservation of energy is written in equation form as  , where is all other forms of energy besides mechanical energy.   
• Commonly encountered forms of energy include electric energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, and thermal energy. Energy is often utilized to do work, but it is not possible to convert all the energy of a system to work.   
• The efficiency  of a machine or human is defined to be  , where is useful work output and  is the energy consumed.

7.7 Power

• Power is the rate at which work is done, or in equation form, for the average power  for work  done over a time ,  .   
• The SI unit for power is the watt  , where  .   
• The power of many devices such as electric motors is also often expressed in horsepower (hp), where  .

or  (conservative forces only) where i and f denote initial and final values. This is known as the conservation of mechanical energy.

7.5 Nonconservative Forces

• A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path.

7.8 Work, Energy, and Power in Humans

• The human body converts energy stored in food into work, thermal energy, and/or chemical energy that is stored in fatty tissue.   
• The rateat which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate, and the corresponding rate

when at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) The energy included in the basal metabolic rate is divided among various systems in the body, with the largest fraction going to the liver and spleen, and the brain coming next. • About  of food calories are used to sustain basic body functions included in the basal metabolic rate. The energy consumption of people during various activities can be determined by measuring their oxygen use, because the digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food.

7.9 World Energy Use

• The relative use of different fuels to provide energy has changed over the years, but fuel use is currently dominated by oil, although natural gas

and solar contributions are increasing.

• Although non-renewable sources dominate, some countries meet a sizeable percentage of their electricity needs from renewable resources.   
• The United States obtains only about  of its energy from renewable sources, mostly hydroelectric power. Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita.   
• Even though, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy, energy can never be created or destroyed, energy that can be used to do work is always partly converted to less useful forms, such as waste heat to the environment, in all of our uses of energy for practical purposes.
