If the object is lifted straight up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its weight . The work done on the mass is then $W = F d = m g h$ . We define this to be the gravitational potential energy $( \\mathrm { P E _ { g } } )$ put into (or gained by) the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with the state of separation between two objects that attract each other by the gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the $\\mathrm { P E _ { g } }$ gained by the object, recognizing that this is energy stored in the gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word \u201csystem\u201d? Potential energy is a property of a system rather than of a single object\u2014due to its physical position. An object\u2019s gravitational potential is due to its position relative to the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object is an external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it increases the gravitational potential energy of the system. Because gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference level at which to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this point to be Earth\u2019s surface, but this point is arbitrary; what is important is the diferencein gravitational potential energy, because this difference is what relates to the work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two rungs of a ladder will be the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs. ",

        "text": "First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made in Falling Objects that all objects fall at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no information about its direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is negligible, the speed of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the roller coaster will have the same final speed whether it falls $2 0 . 0 \\mathsf { m }$ straight down or takes a more complicated path like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but by far less than $5 . 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m } / \\mathsf { s }$ . Finally, note that speed can be found at anyheight along the way by simply using the appropriate value of $h$ at the point of interest. ",

On a smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an incline (see Figure 7.9). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll 1 m on the level surface. Find the velocity of the marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble\u2019s kinetic energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point. ",
