How do we find instantaneous acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average acceleration that is representative of the motion. Figure 2.17 shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two very different motions. In Figure 2.17(a), the acceleration varies slightly and the average over the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about $1 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s } ^ { 2 }$ ). In Figure 2.17(b), the acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of $+ 3 . 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s } ^ { 2 }$ and $- 2 . 0 \\mathrm { m } / \\mathrm { s } ^ { 2 }$ , respectively.

This was not the case in Example 2.7, where a positive acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity. In fact, a negative acceleration will increasea negative velocity. For example, the train moving to the left in Figure 2.22 is sped up by an acceleration to the left. In that case, both $v$ and are negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up.
