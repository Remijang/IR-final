        "text": "INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR MOMENTUM AND COLLISIONS We use the term momentum in various ways in everyday language, and most of these ways are consistent with its precise scientific definition. We speak of sports teams or politicians gaining and maintaining the momentum to win. We also recognize that momentum has something to do with collisions. For example, looking at the rugby players in the photograph colliding and falling to the ground, we expect their momenta to have great effects in the resulting collisions. Generally, momentum implies a tendency to continue on course\u2014to move in the same direction\u2014and is associated with great mass and speed. ",
