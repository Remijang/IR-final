8.7 Introduction to Rocket Propulsion

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• State Newton’s third law of motion.   
• Explain the principle involved in propulsion of rockets and jet engines.   
• Derive an expression for the acceleration of the rocket and discuss the factors that affect the acceleration.   
• Describe the function of a space shuttle.

Rockets range in size from fireworks so small that ordinary people use them to immense Saturn Vs that once propelled massive payloads toward the Moon. The propulsion of all rockets, jet engines, deflating balloons, and even squids and octopuses is explained by the same physical principle—Newton’s third law of motion. Matter is forcefully ejected from a system, producing an equal and opposite reaction on what remains. Another common example is the recoil of a gun. The gun exerts a force on a bullet to accelerate it and consequently experiences an equal and opposite force, causing the gun’s recoil or kick.

Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Propulsion of a Balloon

Hold a balloon and fill it with air. Then, let the balloon go. In which direction does the air come out of the balloon and in which direction does the balloon get propelled? If you fill the balloon with water and then let the balloon go, does the balloon’s direction change? Explain your answer.

Figure 8.12 shows a rocket accelerating straight up. In part (a), the rocket has a mass  and a velocity  relative to Earth, and hence a momentum . In part (b), a time  has elapsed in which the rocket has ejected a mass  of hot gas at a velocity  relative to the rocket. The remainder of the mass  now has a greater velocity  . The momentum of the entire system (rocket plus expelled gas) has actually decreased because the force of gravity has acted for a time  , producing a negative impulse  . (Remember that impulse is the net external force on a system multiplied by the time it acts, and it equals the change in momentum of the system.) So, the center of mass of the system is in free fall but, by rapidly expelling mass, part of the system can accelerate upward. It is a commonly held misconception that the rocket exhaust pushes on the ground. If we consider thrust; that is, the force exerted on the rocket by the exhaust gases, then a rocket’s thrust is greater in outer space than in the atmosphere or on the launch pad. In fact, gases are easier to expel into a vacuum.

By calculating the change in momentum for the entire system over  , and equating this change to the impulse, the following expression can be shown to be a good approximation for the acceleration of the rocket.

“The rocket” is that part of the system remaining after the gas is ejected, and  is the acceleration due to gravity.

Acceleration of a Rocket

Acceleration of a rocket is

where is the acceleration of the rocket,  is the exhaust velocity,  is the mass of the rocket, is the mass of the ejected gas, and  is the time in which the gas is ejected.

A rocket’s acceleration depends on three major factors, consistent with the equation for acceleration of a rocket . First, the greater the exhaust velocity of the gases relative to the rocket,  , the greater the acceleration is. The practical limit for  is about  for conventional (non-nuclear) hot-gas propulsion systems. The second factor is the rate at which mass is ejected from the rocket. This is the factor  in the equation. The quantity  , with units of newtons, is called "thrust.” The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater its thrust, and the greater its acceleration. The third factor is the mass of the rocket. The smaller the mass is (all other factors being the same), the greater the acceleration. The rocket mass decreases dramatically during flight because most of the rocket is fuel to begin with, so that acceleration increases continuously, reaching a maximum just before the fuel is exhausted.

Factors Affecting a Rocket’s Acceleration

• The greater the exhaust velocity  of the gases relative to the rocket, the greater the acceleration.   
• The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater its acceleration.   
• The smaller the rocket’s mass (all other factors being the same), the greater the acceleration.

EXAMPLE 8.8

Calculating Acceleration: Initial Acceleration of a Moon Launch

A Saturn V’s mass at liftoff was  , its fuel-burn rate was  , and the exhaust velocity was  . Calculate its initial acceleration.

Strategy

This problem is a straightforward application of the expression for acceleration because  is the unknown and all of the terms on the right side of the equation are given.

Solution

Substituting the given values into the equation for acceleration yields

Discussion

This value is fairly small, even for an initial acceleration. The acceleration does increase steadily as the rocket burns fuel, because decreases while  and  remain constant. Knowing this acceleration and the mass of the rocket, you can show that the thrust of the engines was  .

To achieve the high speeds needed to hop continents, obtain orbit, or escape Earth’s gravity altogether, the mass of the rocket other than fuel must be as small as possible. It can be shown that, in the absence of air resistance and neglecting gravity, the final velocity of a one-stage rocket initially at rest is

where  is the natural logarithm of the ratio of the initial mass of the rocket  to what is left  after all of the fuel is exhausted. (Note that  is actually the change in velocity, so the equation can be used for any segment of the flight. If we start from rest, the change in velocity equals the final velocity.) For example, let us calculate the mass ratio needed to escape Earth’s gravity starting from rest, given that the escape velocity from Earth is about  , and assuming an exhaust velocity  .

Solving for  gives

Thus, the mass of the rocket is

This result means that only of the mass is left when the fuel is burnt, and of the initial mass was fuel. Expressed as percentages,  of the rocket is fuel, while payload, engines, fuel tanks, and other components make up only  . Taking air resistance and gravitational force into account, the mass  remaining can only be about  . It is difficult to build a rocket in which the fuel has a mass 180 times everything else. The solution is multistage rockets. Each stage only needs to achieve part of the final velocity and is discarded after it burns its fuel. The result is that each successive stage can have smaller engines and more payload relative to its fuel. Once out of the atmosphere, the ratio of payload to fuel becomes more favorable, too.

The space shuttle was an attempt at an economical vehicle with some reusable parts, such as the solid fuel boosters and the craft itself. (See Figure 8.13) The shuttle’s need to be operated by humans, however, made it at least as costly for launching satellites as expendable, unpiloted rockets. Ideally, the shuttle would only have been used when human activities were required for the success of a mission, such as the repair of the Hubble space telescope. Rockets with satellites can also be launched from airplanes. Using airplanes has the double advantage that the initial velocity is significantly above zero and a rocket can avoid most of the atmosphere’s resistance.

Section Summary

8.1 Linear Momentum and Force

Linear momentum (momentumfor brevity) is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity.   
• In symbols, linear momentum is defined to be  ， where  is the mass of the system and is its velocity.   
• The SI unit for momentum is  .   
• Newton’s second law of motion in terms of momentum states that the net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. In symbols, Newton’s second law of motion is defined to be   is the net external force,  is the change in momentum, and  is the change time.

8.2 Impulse

• Impulse, or change in momentum, equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts:    
Forces are usually not constant over a period of time.

8.3 Conservation of Momentum

• The conservation of momentum principle is written Ptot = constant or  (isolated system),  is the initial total momentum and  is the

total momentum some time later.   
• An isolated system is defined to be one for which the net external force is zero  ).   
• During projectile motion and where air resistance is negligible, momentum is conserved in the horizontal direction because horizontal forces are zero.   
• Conservation of momentum applies only when the net external force is zero.   
The conservation of momentum principle is valid when considering systems of particles.

8.4 Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

• An elastic collision is one that conserves internal kinetic energy.   
• Conservation of kinetic energy and momentum together allow the final velocities to be calculated in terms of initial velocities and masses in one dimensional two-body collisions.

8.5 Inelastic Collisions in One Dimension

• An inelastic collision is one in which the internal kinetic energy changes (it is not conserved).   
• A collision in which the objects stick together is sometimes called perfectly inelastic because it reduces internal kinetic energy more than does any other type of inelastic collision.   
• Sports science and technologies also use physics concepts such as momentum and rotational motion and vibrations.

8.6 Collisions of Point Masses in Two Dimensions

The approach to two-dimensional collisions is to choose a convenient coordinate system and break

the motion into components along perpendicular axes. Choose a coordinate system with the  -axis parallel to the velocity of the incoming particle.   
Two-dimensional collisions of point masses where mass 2 is initially at rest conserve momentum along the initial direction of mass 1 (the  -axis), stated by  cos  cos  and along the direction perpendicular to the initial direction (the  -axis) stated by  .   
The internal kinetic before and after the collision of two objects that have equal masses is  Point masses are structureless particles that

cannot spin.

8.7 Introduction to Rocket Propulsion

• Newton’s third law of motion states that to every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.   
• Acceleration of a rocket is  .   
• A rocket’s acceleration depends on three main factors. They are 1. The greater the exhaust velocity of the gases, the greater the acceleration. 2. The faster the rocket burns its fuel, the greater its acceleration. 3. The smaller the rocket's mass, the greater the acceleration.

8.7 Introduction to Rocket Propulsion

53. Professional Application

Antiballistic missiles (ABMs) are designed to have very large accelerations so that they may intercept fast-moving incoming missiles in the short time available. What is the takeoff acceleration of a 10,000-kg ABM that expels  of gas per second at an exhaust velocity of 

54. Professional Application What is the acceleration of a 5000-kg rocket taking off from the Moon, where the acceleration due to gravity is only  , if the rocket expels  of gas per second at an exhaust velocity of 

55. Professional Application Calculate the increase in velocity of a  space probe that expels  of its mass at an exhaust velocity of  . You may assume the gravitational force is negligible at the probe’s location.

56. Professional Application Ion-propulsion rockets have been proposed for use in space. They employ atomic ionization techniques and nuclear energy sources to produce extremely high exhaust velocities, perhaps as great as  . These techniques allow a much more favorable payload-to-fuel ratio. To illustrate this fact: (a) Calculate the increase in velocity of a 20,000-kg space probe that expels only  of its mass at the given exhaust velocity. (b) These engines are usually designed to produce a very small thrust for a very long time—the type of engine that might be useful on a trip to the outer planets, for example. Calculate the acceleration of such an engine if it expels  at the given velocity, assuming the acceleration due to gravity is negligible.

57. Derive the equation for the vertical acceleration of a rocket.

58. Professional Application (a) Calculate the maximum rate at which a rocket can expel gases if its acceleration cannot exceed seven times that of gravity. The mass of the rocket just as it runs out of fuel is  , and its exhaust velocity is  . Assume that the acceleration of gravity is the same as on Earth’s surface  . (b) Why might it be necessary to limit the acceleration of a rocket?

59. Given the following data for a fire extinguisher-toy wagon rocket experiment, calculate the average exhaust velocity of the gases expelled from the extinguisher. Starting from rest, the final velocity is  . The total mass is initially  and is  after the extinguisher is fired.

60. How much of a single-stage rocket that is 100,000 kg can be anything but fuel if the rocket is to have a final speed of  , given that it expels gases at an exhaust velocity of 

61. Professional Application (a)  squid initially at rest ejects  of fluid with a velocity of  . What is the recoil velocity of the squid if the ejection is done in 0.100 s and there is a 5.00-N frictional force opposing the squid’s movement. (b) How much energy is lost to work done against friction?

62. Unreasonable Results

Squids have been reported to jump from the ocean and travel  (measured horizontally) before re-entering the water. (a) Calculate the initial speed of the squid if it leaves the water at an angle of  , assuming negligible lift from the air and negligible air resistance. (b) The squid propels itself by squirting water. What fraction of its mass would it have to eject in order to achieve the speed found in the previous part? The water is ejected at  ; gravitational force and friction are neglected. (c) What is unreasonable about the results? (d) Which premise is unreasonable, or which premises are inconsistent?

63. Construct Your Own Problem

Consider an astronaut in deep space cut free from her space ship and needing to get back to it. The astronaut has a few packages that she can throw away to move herself toward the ship. Construct a problem in which you calculate the time it takes her to get back by throwing all the packages at one time compared to throwing them one at a time. Among the things to be considered are the masses involved, the force she can exert on the packages through some distance, and the distance to the ship.

64. Construct Your Own Problem Consider an artillery projectile striking armor plating. Construct a problem in which you find the force exerted by the projectile on the plate. Among the things to be considered are the mass and speed of the projectile and the distance over which its speed is reduced. Your instructor may also wish for you to consider the relative merits of depleted uranium versus lead projectiles based on the greater density of uranium.
