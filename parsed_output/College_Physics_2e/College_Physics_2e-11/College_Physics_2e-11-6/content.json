        "text": "Mercury manometers are often used to measure arterial blood pressure. An inflatable cuff is placed on the upper arm as shown in Figure 11.15. By squeezing the bulb, the person making the measurement exerts pressure, which is transmitted undiminished to both the main artery in the arm and the manometer. When this applied pressure exceeds blood pressure, blood flow below the cuff is cut off. The person making the measurement then slowly lowers the applied pressure and listens for blood flow to resume. Blood pressure pulsates because of the pumping action of the heart, reaching a maximum, called systolic pressure, and a minimum, called diastolic pressure, with each heartbeat. Systolic pressure is measured by noting the value of $h$ when blood flow first begins as cuff pressure is lowered. Diastolic pressure is measured by noting when blood flows without interruption. The typical blood pressure of a young adult raises the mercury to a height of $1 2 0 ~ \\mathsf { m m }$ at systolic and $8 0 ~ \\mathsf { m m }$ at diastolic. This is commonly quoted as 120 over 80, or 120/80. The first pressure is representative of the maximum output of the heart; the second is due to the elasticity of the arteries in maintaining the pressure between beats. The density of the mercury fluid in the manometer is 13.6 times greater than water, so the height of the fluid will be $\\scriptscriptstyle { 1 / 1 3 . 6 }$ of that in a water manometer. This reduced height can make measurements difficult, so mercury manometers are used to measure larger pressures, such as blood pressure. The density of mercury is such that $1 . 0 \\ : \\mathrm { m m \\ : H g } = 1 3 3 \\ : \\mathrm { P a }$ . ",
