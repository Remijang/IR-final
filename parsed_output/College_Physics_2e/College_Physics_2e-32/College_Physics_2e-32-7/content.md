# 32.7 Nuclear Weapons

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss different types of fission and thermonuclear bombs.   
• Explain the ill effects of nuclear explosion.

The world was in turmoil when fission was discovered in 1938. The discovery of fission, made by two German physicists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, was quickly verified by two Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch. Fermi, among others, soon found that not only did neutrons induce fission; more neutrons were produced during fission. The possibility of a self-sustained chain reaction was immediately recognized by leading scientists the world over. The enormous energy known to be in nuclei, but considered inaccessible, now seemed to be available on a large scale.

Within months after the announcement of the discovery of fission, Adolf Hitler banned the export of uranium from newly occupied Czechoslovakia. It seemed that the military value of uranium had been recognized in Nazi Germany, and that a serious effort to build a nuclear bomb had begun.

Alarmed scientists, many of them who fled Nazi Germany, decided to take action. None was more famous or revered than Einstein. It was felt that his help was needed to get the American government to make a serious effort at nuclear weapons as a matter of survival. Leo Szilard, an escaped Hungarian physicist, took a draft of a letter to Einstein, who, although pacifistic, signed the final version. The letter was for President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the German potential to build extremely powerful bombs of a new type. It was sent in August of 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland that marked the start of World War II.

It was not until December 6, 1941, the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, that the United States made a massive commitment to building a nuclear bomb. The top secret Manhattan Project was a crash program aimed at beating the Germans. It was carried out in remote locations, such as Los Alamos, New Mexico, whenever possible, and eventually came to cost billions of dollars and employ the efforts of more than 100,000 people. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967), whose talent and ambitions made him ideal, was chosen to head the project. The first major step was made by Enrico Fermi and his group in December 1942, when they achieved the first self-sustained nuclear reactor. This first “atomic pile”, built in a squash court at the University of Chicago, used carbon blocks to thermalize neutrons. It not only proved that the chain reaction was possible, it began the era of nuclear reactors. Glenn Seaborg, an American chemist and physicist, received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1951 for discovery of several transuranic elements, including plutonium. Carbon-moderated reactors are relatively inexpensive and simple in design and are still used for breeding plutonium, such as at Chernobyl, where two such reactors remain in operation.

Plutonium was recognized as easier to fission with neutrons and, hence, a superior fission material very early in the Manhattan Project. Plutonium availability was uncertain, and so a uranium bomb was developed simultaneously. Figure 32.24 shows a gun-type bomb, which takes two subcritical uranium masses and blows them together. To get an appreciable yield, the critical mass must be held together by the explosive charges inside the cannon barrel for a few microseconds. Since the buildup of the uranium chain reaction is relatively slow, the device to hold the critica mass together can be relatively simple. Owing to the fact that the rate of spontaneous fission is low, a neutron source is triggered at the same time the critical mass is assembled.



Plutonium’s special properties necessitated a more sophisticated critical mass assembly, shown schematically in Figure 32.25. A spherical mass of plutonium is surrounded by shape charges (high explosives that release most of their blast in one direction) that implode the plutonium, crushing it into a smaller volume to form a critical mass. The implosion technique is faster and more effective, because it compresses three-dimensionally rather than onedimensionally as in the gun-type bomb. Again, a neutron source must be triggered at just the correct time to initiate the chain reaction.

Owing to its complexity, the plutonium bomb needed to be tested before there could be any attempt to use it. On July 16, 1945, the test named Trinity was conducted in the isolated Alamogordo Desert about 200 miles south of Los Alamos (see Figure 32.26). A new age had begun. The yield of this device was about 10 kilotons (kT), the equivalent of 5000 of the largest conventional bombs.

Although Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945, Japan had been steadfastly refusing to surrender for many months, forcing large casualties. Invasion plans by the Allies estimated a million casualties of their own and untold losses of Japanese lives. The bomb was viewed as a way to end the war. The first was a uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6. Its yield of about $1 5 \mathsf { k T }$ destroyed the city and killed an estimated 80,000 people, with 100,000 more being seriously injured (see Figure 32.27). The second was a plutonium bomb dropped on Nagasaki only three days later, on August 9. Its $2 0 \kappa \tau$ yield killed at least 50,000 people, something less than Hiroshima because of the hilly terrain and the fact that it was a few kilometers off target. The Japanese were told that one bomb a week would be dropped until they surrendered unconditionally, which they did on August 14. In actuality, the United States had only enough plutonium for one more and as yet unassembled bomb.

Knowing that fusion produces several times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission, some scientists pushed the idea of a fusion bomb starting very early on. Calling this bomb the Super, they realized that it could have another advantage over fission—high-energy neutrons would aid fusion, while they are ineffective in $^ { 2 3 9 } \mathrm { P u }$ fission. Thus the fusion bomb could be virtually unlimited in energy release. The first such bomb was detonated by the United States on October 31, 1952, at Eniwetok Atoll with a yield of 10 megatons (MT), about 670 times that of the fission bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The USSR followed with a fusion device of their own in August 1953, and a weapons race, beyond the aim of this text to discuss, continued until the end of the Cold War.

Figure 32.28 shows a simple diagram of how a thermonuclear bomb is constructed. A fission bomb is exploded next to fusion fuel in the solid form of lithium deuteride. Before the shock wave blows it apart, rays heat and compress the fuel, and neutrons create tritium through the reaction $n + ^ { 6 } \mathrm { L i }  ^ { 3 } \mathrm { H } + ^ { 4 }$ . Additional fusion and fission fuels are enclosed in a dense shell of $^ { 2 3 8 } \mathrm { U }$ . The shell reflects some of the neutrons back into the fuel to enhance its fusion, but at high internal temperatures fast neutrons are created that also cause the plentiful and inexpensive to fission, part of what allows thermonuclear bombs to be so large.

The energy yield and the types of energy produced by nuclear bombs can be varied. Energy yields in current arsenals range from about $0 . 1 \mathsf { k T }$ to $2 0 \mathsf { M } \mathsf { T } ,$ , although the USSR once detonated a 67 MT device. Nuclear bombs differ from conventional explosives in more than size. Figure 32.29 shows the approximate fraction of energy output in various forms for conventional explosives and for two types of nuclear bombs. Nuclear bombs put a much larger fraction of their output into thermal energy than do conventional bombs, which tend to concentrate the energy in blast. Another difference is the immediate and residual radiation energy from nuclear weapons. This can be adjusted to put more energy into radiation (the so-called neutron bomb) so that the bomb can be used to irradiate advancing troops without killing friendly troops with blast and heat.

At its peak in 1986, the combined arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union totaled about 60,000 nuclear warheads. In addition, the British, French, and Chinese each have several hundred bombs of various sizes, and a few other countries have a small number. Nuclear weapons are generally divided into two categories. Strategic nuclear weapons are those intended for military targets, such as bases and missile complexes, and moderate to large cities. There were about 20,000 strategic weapons in 1988. Tactical weapons are intended for use in smaller battles. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1989, most of the 32,000 tactical weapons (including Cruise missiles, artillery shells, land mines, torpedoes, depth charges, and backpacks) have been demobilized, and parts of the strategic weapon systems are being dismantled with warheads and missiles being disassembled. According to the Treaty of Moscow of 2002, Russia and the United States have been required to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenal down to about 2000 warheads each.

A few small countries have built or are capable of building nuclear bombs, as are some terrorist groups. Two things are needed—a minimum level of technical expertise and sufficient fissionable material. The first is easy. Fissionable material is controlled but is also available. There are international agreements and organizations that attempt to control nuclear proliferation, but it is increasingly difficult given the availability of fissionable material and the small amount needed for a crude bomb. The production of fissionable fuel itself is technologically difficult. However, the presence of large amounts of such material worldwide, though in the hands of a few, makes control and

accountability crucial.

# Section Summary

# 32.1 Diagnostics and Medical Imaging

• Radiopharmaceuticals are compounds that are used for medical imaging and therapeutics.   
• The process of attaching a radioactive substance is called tagging.   
• Table 32.1 lists certain diagnostic uses of radiopharmaceuticals including the isotope and activity typically used in diagnostics.   
• One common imaging device is the Anger camera, which consists of a lead collimator, radiation detectors, and an analysis computer.   
• Tomography performed with -emitting radiopharmaceuticals is called SPECT and has the advantages of x-ray CT scans coupled with organand function-specific drugs.   
• PET is a similar technique that uses $\beta ^ { + }$ emitters and detects the two annihilation rays, which aid to localize the source.



# 32.2 Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation

• The biological effects of ionizing radiation are due to two effects it has on cells: interference with cell reproduction, and destruction of cell function.   
• A radiation dose unit called the rad is defined in terms of the ionizing energy deposited per kilogram of tissue: $\mathrm { 1 ~ r a d = 0 . 0 1 ~ J / k g . }$   
• The SI unit for radiation dose is the gray (Gy), which is defined to be $1 \mathrm { G y } = 1 \mathrm { J } / \mathrm { k g } = 1 0 0$ rad.   
• To account for the effect of the type of particle creating the ionization, we use the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) or quality factor (QF) given in Table 32.2 and define a unit called the roentgen equivalent man (rem) as $\mathrm { r e m } = \mathrm { r a d } \times \mathrm { R B E }$   
• Particles that have short ranges or create large ionization densities have RBEs greater than unity. The SI equivalent of the rem is the sievert (Sv), defined to be $\mathrm { S v } = \mathrm { G y } \times \mathrm { R B E }$ and $1 \mathrm { S v } = 1 0 0$ rem.   
Whole-body, single-exposure doses of 0.1 Sv or less are low doses while those of 0.1 to 1 Sv are moderate, and those over 1 Sv are high doses. Some immediate radiation effects are given in Table 32.4. Effects due to low doses are not observed, but their risk is assumed to be directly proportional to those of high doses, an assumption known as the linear hypothesis. Long-term effects are cancer deaths at the rate of $1 0 / 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ and genetic defects at roughly one-third this rate. Background radiation doses and sources are given in Table 32.5. World-wide average radiation exposure from natural sources, including radon, is about $3 \mathsf { m } \mathsf { S } \mathsf { v } ,$ , or 300 mrem. Radiation protection utilizes shielding, distance, and time to limit exposure.

# 32.3 Therapeutic Uses of Ionizing Radiation

• Radiotherapy is the use of ionizing radiation to treat ailments, now limited to cancer therapy.   
• The sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation enhances the ratio of cancer cells killed to normal cells killed, which is called the therapeutic ratio.   
• Doses for various organs are limited by the tolerance of normal tissue for radiation. Treatment is localized in one region of the body and spread out in time.

# 32.4 Food Irradiation

• Food irradiation is the treatment of food with ionizing radiation.

• Irradiating food can destroy insects and bacteria by creating free radicals and radiolytic products that can break apart cell membranes.   
• Food irradiation has produced no observable negative short-term effects for humans, but its long-term effects are unknown.

# 32.5 Fusion

• Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two nuclei are combined to form a larger nucleus. It releases energy when light nuclei are fused to form medium-mass nuclei.   
• Fusion is the source of energy in stars, with the proton-proton cycle, $\begin{array} { r l } & { \dot { \mathrm { 1 } } _ { \mathrm { H } } + \dot { \mathrm { 1 } } _ { \mathrm { H } }  \dot { \mathrm { 2 } } _ { \mathrm { H } } + e ^ { + } + v _ { \mathrm { e } } \qquad \quad ( \mathrm { 0 . 4 2 M e V } ) } \\ & { \dot { \mathrm { 1 } } _ { \mathrm { H } } + \dot { \mathrm { 2 } } _ { \mathrm { H } }  \dot { \mathrm { 3 } } _ { \mathrm { H e } + \gamma } \qquad \quad ( \mathrm { 5 . 4 9 M e V } ) } \\ & { \dot { \mathrm { 3 } } _ { \mathrm { H e } + } \dot { \mathrm { 3 } } _ { \mathrm { H e } }  \dot { \mathrm { 4 } } _ { \mathrm { H e } + } \dot { \mathrm { 1 } } _ { \mathrm { H } } + \dot { \mathrm { 1 } } _ { \mathrm { H } } \qquad ( \mathrm { 1 2 . 8 6 M e V } ) \enspace \enspace \enspace } \end{array}$ being the principal sequence of energy-producing reactions in our Sun. The overall effect of the proton-proton cycle is $2 e ^ { - } + 4 ^ { 1 } \mathrm { H }  { ^ 4 } \mathrm { H e } + 2 v _ { \mathrm { e } } + 6 \gamma$ $( 2 6 . 7 \mathrm { M e V } )$ ， where the $2 6 . 7 \mathsf { M e V }$ includes the energy of the positrons emitted and annihilated. Attempts to utilize controlled fusion as an energy source on Earth are related to deuterium and tritium, and the reactions play important roles. Ignition is the condition under which controlled fusion is self-sustaining; it has not yet been achieved. Break-even, in which the fusion energy output is as great as the external energy input, has nearly been achieved.   
• Magnetic confinement and inertial confinement are the two methods being developed for heating fuel to sufficiently high temperatures, at sufficient density, and for sufficiently long times to achieve ignition. The first method uses magnetic fields and the second method uses the momentum of impinging laser beams for confinement.

# 32.6 Fission

• Nuclear fission is a reaction in which a nucleus is split.   
• Fission releases energy when heavy nuclei are split into medium-mass nuclei.   
• Self-sustained fission is possible, because neutron-induced fission also produces neutrons that can induce other fissions, $n + { } ^ { A } X  \mathrm { F F } _ { 1 } + \mathrm { F F } _ { 2 } + x n$ , where $\mathrm { F F } _ { 1 }$ and $\mathrm { F F } _ { 2 }$ are the two daughter nuclei, or fission fragments, and $x$ is the number of neutrons produced. A minimum mass, called the critical mass, should be present to achieve criticality.

• More than a critical mass can produce supercriticality. • The production of new or different isotopes (especially $^ { 2 3 9 } \mathrm { P u }$ ) by nuclear transformation is called breeding, and reactors designed for this purpose are called breeder reactors.

# 32.7 Nuclear Weapons

• There are two types of nuclear weapons—fission bombs use fission alone, whereas thermonuclear



bombs use fission to ignite fusion.   
• Both types of weapons produce huge numbers of nuclear reactions in a very short time.   
• Energy yields are measured in kilotons or megatons of equivalent conventional explosives and range from $0 . 1 \mathsf { k T }$ to more than 20 MT.   
• Nuclear bombs are characterized by far more thermal output and nuclear radiation output than conventional explosives.

12. Compare a low dose of radiation to a human with a low dose of radiation used in food treatment.   
13. Suppose one food irradiation plant uses a $^ { 1 3 7 } \mathrm { C s }$ source while another uses an equal activity of . Assuming equal fractions of the rays from the sources are absorbed, why is more time needed to get the same dose using the source?

# 32.5 Fusion

14. Why does the fusion of light nuclei into heavier nuclei release energy?   
15. Energy input is required to fuse medium-mass nuclei, such as iron or cobalt, into more massive nuclei. Explain why.

17. Give reasons justifying the contention made in the text that energy from the fusion reaction is relatively difficult to capture and utilize.

# 32.6 Fission

18. Explain why the fission of heavy nuclei releases energy. Similarly, why is it that energy input is required to fission light nuclei?   
19. Explain, in terms of conservation of momentum and energy, why collisions of neutrons with protons will thermalize neutrons better than collisions with oxygen.   
20. The ruins of the Chernobyl reactor are enclosed in a huge concrete structure built around it after the accident. Some rain penetrates the building in winter, and radioactivity from the building increases. What does this imply is happening inside?   
21. Since the uranium or plutonium nucleus fissions into several fission fragments whose mass distribution covers a wide range of pieces, would you expect more residual radioactivity from fission than fusion? Explain.   
22. The core of a nuclear reactor generates a large amount of thermal energy from the decay of fission products, even when the power-producing fission chain reaction is turned off. Would this residual heat be greatest after the reactor has run for a long time or short time? What if the reactor has been shut down for months?   
23. How can a nuclear reactor contain many critical masses and not go supercritical? What methods are used to control the fission in the reactor?   
24. Why can heavy nuclei with odd numbers of neutrons be induced to fission with thermal neutrons, whereas those with even numbers of neutrons require more energy input to induce fission?   
25. Why is a conventional fission nuclear reactor not able to explode as a bomb?

26. What are some of the reasons that plutonium rather than uranium is used in all fission bombs and as the trigger in all fusion bombs?   
27. Use the laws of conservation of momentum and energy to explain how a shape charge can direct most of the energy released in an explosion in a specific direction. (Note that this is similar to the situation in guns and cannons—most of the energy goes into the bullet.)   
28. How does the lithium deuteride in the thermonuclear bomb shown in Figure 32.28 supply tritium $( ^ { 3 } \mathrm { H } )$ as well as deuterium $( ^ { 2 } \mathrm { H } ) \ ?$   
29. Fallout from nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere is mainly $^ { 9 0 } \mathrm { S r }$ and $^ { 1 3 7 } \mathrm { C s }$ , which have 28.6- and 32.2-y half-lives, respectively. Atmospheric tests were terminated in most countries in 1963, although China only did so in 1980. It has been found that environmental activities of these two isotopes are decreasing faster than their half-lives. Why might this be?
