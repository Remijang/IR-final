Hot air rises because its volume increases, which causes the hot air\u2019s density to be smaller than the density of surrounding air, causing a buoyant (upward) force on the hot air. The same happens in all liquids and gases, driving natural heat transfer upwards in homes, oceans, and weather systems. Solids also undergo thermal expansion. Railroad tracks and bridges, for example, have expansion joints to allow them to freely expand and contract with temperature changes. ",

As is discussed in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature, an increase in temperature implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the individual atoms. In a solid, unlike in a gas, the atoms or molecules are closely packed together, but their kinetic energy (in the form of small, rapid vibrations) pushes neighboring atoms or molecules apart from each other. This neighbor-to-neighbor pushing results in a slightly greater distance, on average, between neighbors, and adds up to a larger size for the whole body. For most substances under ordinary conditions, there is no preferred direction, and an increase in temperature will increase the solid\u2019s size by a certain fraction in each dimension. ",

Water expands with increasing temperature (its density decreases) when it is at temperatures greater than $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ( 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F } )$ . However, it expands with decreasingtemperature when it is between $+ 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ( 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F }$ to $3 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { F }$ . Water is densest at $+ 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } .$ . (See Figure 13.12.) Perhaps the most striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools down to $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ it is denser than the remaining water and thus will sink to the bottom. This \u201cturnover\u201d results in a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled. Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . If the temperature in the surface layer drops below $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , the water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely freeze over. The ice on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter\u2019s harsh exterior air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in $4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water.
