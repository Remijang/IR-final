A stereo has at least two speakers creating sound waves, and waves can reflect from walls. All these waves superimpose. An example of sounds that vary over time from constructive to destructive is found in the combined whine of airplane jets heard by a stationary passenger.

Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. These waves are formed by the superposition of two or more moving waves, such as illustrated in Figure 16.36 for two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a standing wave. Waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves. There are other standing waves, such as on guitar strings and in organ pipes. With the glass of milk, the two waves that produce standing waves may come from reflections from the side of the glass.

Figure 16.37 and Figure 16.38 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. Nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there. The word antinode is used to denote the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. Standing waves on strings have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed $v _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ of the disturbance on the string. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is determined by the distance between the points where the string is fixed in place. ",

Therefore, the fundamental frequency is $f _ { 1 } = v _ { \\mathrm { w } } / \\lambda _ { 1 } = v _ { \\mathrm { w } } / 2 L$ . In this case, the overtones or harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency. As seen in Figure 16.38, the first harmonic can easily be calculated since $\\lambda _ { 2 } = L$ . Thus, $f _ { 2 } = v _ { \\mathrm { w } } / \\lambda _ { 2 } = v _ { \\mathrm { w } } / 2 L = 2 f _ { 1 }$ . Similarly, $f _ { 3 } = 3 f _ { 1 }$ , and so on.
