# 14.7 Radiation

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss heat transfer by radiation.   
• Explain the power of different materials.

You can feel the heat transfer from a fire and from the Sun. Similarly, you can sometimes tell that the oven is hot without touching its door or looking inside—it may just warm you as you walk by. The space between the Earth and the Sun is largely empty, without any possibility of heat transfer by convection or conduction. In these examples, heat is transferred by radiation. That is, the hot body emits electromagnetic waves that are absorbed by our skin: no medium is required for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Different names are used for electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.

The energy of electromagnetic radiation depends on the wavelength (color) and varies over a wide range: a smaller wavelength (or higher frequency) corresponds to a higher energy. Because more heat is radiated at higher temperatures, a temperature change is accompanied by a color change. Take, for example, an electrical element on a stove, which glows from red to orange, while the higher-temperature steel in a blast furnace glows from yellow to white. The radiation you feel is mostly infrared, which corresponds to a lower temperature than that of the electrical element and the steel. The radiated energy depends on its intensity, which is represented in the figure below by the height of the distribution.

Electromagnetic Waves explains more about the electromagnetic spectrum and Introduction to Quantum Physics discusses how the decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in energy.

All objects absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation. The rate of heat transfer by radiation is largely determined by the color of the object. Black is the most effective, and white is the least effective. People living in hot climates generally avoid wearing black clothing, for instance. Similarly, black asphalt in a parking lot will be hotter than adjacent gray sidewalk on a summer day, because black absorbs better than gray. The reverse is also true—black radiates better than gray. Thus, on a clear summer night, the asphalt will be colder than the gray sidewalk, because black radiates the energy more rapidly than gray. An idealradiatoris the same color as an idealabsorber, and captures all the radiation that falls on it. In contrast, white is a poor absorber and is also a poor radiator. A white object reflects all radiation, like a mirror. (A perfect, polished white surface is mirror-like in appearance, and a crushed mirror looks white.)

Gray objects have a uniform ability to absorb all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Colored objects behave in similar but more complex ways, which gives them a particular color in the visible range and may make them special in other ranges of the nonvisible spectrum. Take, for example, the strong absorption of infrared radiation by the skin, which allows us to be very sensitive to it.

The rate of heat transfer by emitted radiation is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law of radiation:

$$
\frac { Q } { t } = \sigma e A T ^ { 4 } ,
$$

where $\sigma = 5 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { J / s } \cdot \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathrm { K } ^ { 4 }$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the object, and $T$ is its absolute temperature in kelvin. The symbol $e$ stands for the emissivity of the object, which is a measure of how well it radiates. An ideal jet-black (or black body) radiator has $e = 1$ , whereas a perfect reflector has $e = 0$ . Real objects fall between these two values. Take, for example, tungsten light bulb filaments which have an $e$ of about , and carbon black (a material used in printer toner), which has the (greatest known) emissivity of about .

The radiation rate is directly proportional to the fourthpowerof the absolute temperature—a remarkably strong temperature dependence. Furthermore, the radiated heat is proportional to the surface area of the object. If you knock apart the coals of a fire, there is a noticeable increase in radiation due to an increase in radiating surface area.

Skin is a remarkably good absorber and emitter of infrared radiation, having an emissivity of 0.97 in the infrared spectrum. Thus, we are all nearly (jet) black in the infrared, in spite of the obvious variations in skin color. This high infrared emissivity is why we can so easily feel radiation on our skin. It is also the basis for the use of night scopes used by law enforcement and the military to detect human beings. Even small temperature variations can be detected because of the $T ^ { 4 }$ dependence. Images, called thermographs, can be used medically to detect regions of abnormally high temperature in the body, perhaps indicative of disease. Similar techniques can be used to detect heat leaks in homes Figure 14.27, optimize performance of blast furnaces, improve comfort levels in work environments, and even remotely map the Earth’s temperature profile.



All objects emit and absorb radiation. The netrate of heat transfer by radiation (absorption minus emission) is related to both the temperature of the object and the temperature of its surroundings. Assuming that an object with a temperature $T _ { 1 }$ is surrounded by an environment with uniform temperature $T _ { 2 }$ , the net rate of heat transfer by radiation is

$$
\frac { Q _ { \mathrm { n e t } } } { t } = \sigma e A \big ( T _ { 2 } ^ { 4 } - T _ { 1 } ^ { 4 } \big ) ,
$$

where $e$ is the emissivity of the object alone. In other words, it does not matter whether the surroundings are white, gray, or black; the balance of radiation into and out of the object depends on how well it emits and absorbs radiation. When $T _ { 2 } > T _ { 1 }$ , the quantity $Q _ { \mathrm { n e t } } / t$ is positive; that is, the net heat transfer is from hot to cold.

# Take-Home Experiment: Temperature in the Sun

Place a thermometer out in the sunshine and shield it from direct sunlight using an aluminum foil. What is the reading? Now remove the shield, and note what the thermometer reads. Take a handkerchief soaked in nail polish remover, wrap it around the thermometer and place it in the sunshine. What does the thermometer read?

# EXAMPLE 14.9

# Calculate the Net Heat Transfer of a Person: Heat Transfer by Radiation

What is the rate of heat transfer by radiation, with an unclothed person standing in a dark room whose ambient temperature is $2 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The person has a normal skin temperature of $3 3 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and a surface area of $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ . The emissivity of skin is 0.97 in the infrared, where the radiation takes place.

# Strategy

We can solve this by using the equation for the rate of radiative heat transfer.

# Solution

Insert the temperatures values $T _ { 2 } = 2 9 5 \ : \mathrm { K }$ and $T _ { 1 } = 3 0 6 { \mathrm { K } }$ , so that

$$
\begin{array} { c } { \displaystyle \frac { Q } { t } = \sigma e A \big ( T _ { 2 } ^ { 4 } - T _ { 1 } ^ { 4 } \big ) } \\ { = \big ( 5 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { J / s } \cdot \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathrm { K } ^ { 4 } \big ) ( 0 . 9 7 ) \big ( 1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \big ) \big [ ( 2 9 5 \mathrm { K } ) ^ { 4 } - ( 3 0 6 \mathrm { K } ) ^ { 4 } \big ] } \\ { = - 9 9 \mathrm { J / s } = - 9 9 \mathrm { W } . } \end{array}
$$

# Discussion

This value is a significant rate of heat transfer to the environment (note the minus sign), considering that a person at rest may produce energy at the rate of 125 W and that conduction and convection will also be transferring energy to the environment. Indeed, we would probably expect this person to feel cold. Clothing significantly reduces heat transfer to the environment by many methods, because clothing slows down both conduction and convection, and has a lower emissivity (especially if it is white) than skin.

The Earth receives almost all its energy from radiation of the Sun and reflects some of it back into outer space. Because the Sun is hotter than the Earth, the net energy flux is from the Sun to the Earth. However, the rate of energy transfer is less than the equation for the radiative heat transfer would predict because the Sun does not fill the sky. The average emissivity ( ) of the Earth is about 0.65, but the calculation of this value is complicated by the fact that the highly reflective cloud coverage varies greatly from day to day. There is a negative feedback (one in which a change produces an effect that opposes that change) between clouds and heat transfer; greater temperatures evaporate more water to form more clouds, which reflect more radiation back into space, reducing the temperature. The often mentioned greenhouse effect is directly related to the variation of the Earth’s emissivity with radiation type (see the figure given below). The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon responsible for providing temperatures suitable for life on Earth. The Earth’s relatively constant temperature is a result of the energy balance between the incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by carbon dioxide $\mathrm { ( C O } _ { 2 } \mathrm { ) }$ ) and water $( \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } \mathrm { O } )$ in the atmosphere and then re-radiated back to the Earth or into outer space. Re-radiation back to the Earth maintains its surface temperature about $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ higher than it would be if there was no atmosphere, similar to the way glass increases temperatures in a greenhouse.



The greenhouse effect and its causes were first predicted by Eunice Newton Foote after she designed and conducted experiments on heating of different gases. After filling flasks with carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and regular air, then also modifying moisture, she placed them in the sun and carefully measured their heating and, especially, their heat retention. She discovered that the ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ flask gained the most temperature and held it the longest. After subsequent research, her paper "Circumstances affecting the Heat of the Sun’s Rays" included conclusions that an atmosphere consisting of more carbon dioxide would be hotter resulting from the gas trapping radiation.

The greenhouse effect is also central to the discussion of global warming due to emission of carbon dioxide and methane (and other so-called greenhouse gases) into the Earth’s atmosphere from industrial production and farming. Changes in global climate could lead to more intense storms, precipitation changes (affecting agriculture), reduction in rain forest biodiversity, and rising sea levels.

Heating and cooling are often significant contributors to energy use in individual homes. Mária Telkes, a Hungarianborn American scientist, was among the foremost developers of solar energy applications in industrial and community use. After inventing a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts, she partnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power. Air warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use. Telkes later worked with the Department of Energy to develop the first solar-electrically powered home. Current research efforts into developing environmentally friendly homes quite often focus on reducing conventional heating and cooling through better building materials, strategically positioning windows to optimize radiation gain from the Sun, and opening spaces to allow convection. It is possible to build a zero-energy house that allows for comfortable living in most

parts of the United States with hot and humid summers and cold winters.

Conversely, dark space is very cold, about $( - 4 5 4 ^ { \mathrm { o } } \mathrm { F } )$ , so that the Earth radiates energy into the dark sky. Owing to the fact that clouds have lower emissivity than either oceans or land masses, they reflect some of the radiation back to the surface, greatly reducing heat transfer into dark space, just as they greatly reduce heat transfer into the atmosphere during the day. The rate of heat transfer from soil and grasses can be so rapid that frost may occur on clear summer evenings, even in warm latitudes.

# CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING

What is the change in the rate of the radiated heat by a body at the temperature $T _ { 1 } = 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ compared to when the body is at the temperature $T _ { 2 } = 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ?$

# Solution

The radiated heat is proportional to the fourth power of the absolutetemperature. Because $T _ { 1 } = 2 9 3 \ : \mathrm { K }$ and $T _ { 2 } = 3 1 3 \mathrm { K }$ , the rate of heat transfer increases by about 30 percent of the original rate.

# Career Connection: Energy Conservation Consultation

The cost of energy is generally believed to remain very high for the foreseeable future. Thus, passive control of heat loss in both commercial and domestic housing will become increasingly important. Energy consultants measure and analyze the flow of energy into and out of houses and ensure that a healthy exchange of air is maintained inside the house. The job prospects for an energy consultant are strong.

# Section Summary

# 14.1 Heat

• Heat and work are the two distinct methods of energy transfer.   
• Heat is energy transferred solely due to a temperature difference.   
Any energy unit can be used for heat transfer, and the most common are kilocalorie (kcal) and joule (J).   
Kilocalorie is defined to be the energy needed to change the temperature of $\displaystyle 1 . 0 0 { \mathsf { k g } }$ of water between $1 4 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and $1 5 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The mechanical equivalent of this heat transfer is $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { k c a l } = 4 1 8 6 \mathrm { J } .$

# 14.2 Temperature Change and Heat Capacity

The transfer of heat $Q$ that leads to a change $\Delta T$ in the temperature of a body with mass $m$ is $Q = m c \Delta T$ , where $c$ is the specific heat of the material. This relationship can also be considered as the definition of specific heat.

# 14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

• Most substances can exist either in solid, liquid, and gas forms, which are referred to as “phases.”

• Phase changes occur at fixed temperatures for a given substance at a given pressure, and these temperatures are called boiling and freezing (or melting) points.   
• During phase changes, heat absorbed or released is given by: $Q = m L$ ， where $L$ is the latent heat coefficient.

# 14.4 Heat Transfer Methods

• Heat is transferred by three different methods: conduction, convection, and radiation.

# 14.5 Conduction

• Heat conduction is the transfer of heat between two objects in direct contact with each other.   
• The rate of heat transfer $Q / t$ (energy per unit time) is proportional to the temperature difference $T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 }$ and the contact area $A$ and inversely proportional to the distance $d$ between the objects: $\frac { Q } { t } = \frac { k A ( T _ { 2 } - T _ { 1 } ) } { d } .$

# 14.6 Convection

• Convection is heat transfer by the macroscopic movement of mass. Convection can be natural or forced and generally transfers thermal energy faster than conduction. Table 14.4 gives wind-chill factors, indicating that moving air has the same chilling effect of much colder stationary air. Convectionthatoc ursalongwithaphasechange can transfer energy from cold regions to warm ones.



# 14.7 Radiation

• Radiation is the rate of heat transfer through the emission or absorption of electromagnetic waves. • The rate of heat transfer depends on the surface area and the fourth power of the absolute temperature:

# Conceptual Questions

# 14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

6. Heat transfer can cause temperature and phase changes. What else can cause these changes?   
7. How does the latent heat of fusion of water help slow the decrease of air temperatures, perhaps preventing temperatures from falling significantly below $0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } _ { : }$ , in the vicinity of large bodies of water?   
8. What is the temperature of ice right after it is formed by freezing water?   
9. If you place $0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ice into $0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ water in an insulated container, what will happen? Will some ice melt, will more water freeze, or will neither take place?   
10. What effect does condensation on a glass of ice water have on the rate at which the ice melts? Will the condensation speed up the melting process or slow it down? $\frac { Q } { t } = \sigma e A T ^ { 4 } .$   
where $\sigma = 5 . 6 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { J / s } \cdot \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathrm { K } ^ { 4 }$ is the   
Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $e$ is the emissivity of the body. For a black body, $e = 1$ whereas a shiny white or perfect reflector has $e = 0$ , with real objects having values of $e$ between 1 and 0. The net rate of heat transfer by radiation is   
$\frac { Q _ { \mathrm { n e t } } } { t } = \sigma e A \big ( T _ { 2 } ^ { 4 } - T _ { 1 } ^ { 4 } \big )$   
where $T _ { 1 }$ is the temperature of an object

11. In very humid climates where there are numerous bodies of water, such as in Florida, it is unusual for temperatures to rise above about $3 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ( 9 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { F } )$ . In deserts, however, temperatures can rise far above this. Explain how the evaporation of water helps limit high temperatures in humid climates.   
12. In winters, it is often warmer in San Francisco than in nearby Sacramento, $1 5 0 { \mathsf { k m } }$ inland. In summers, it is nearly always hotter in Sacramento. Explain how the bodies of water surrounding San Francisco moderate its extreme temperatures.   
13. Putting a lid on a boiling pot greatly reduces the heat transfer necessary to keep it boiling. Explain why.   
14. Freeze-dried foods have been dehydrated in a vacuum. During the process, the food freezes and must be heated to facilitate dehydration. Explain both how the vacuum speeds up dehydration and why the food freezes as a result.   
15. When still air cools by radiating at night, it is unusual for temperatures to fall below the dew point. Explain why.   
16. In a physics classroom demonstration, an instructor inflates a balloon by mouth and then cools it in liquid nitrogen. When cold, the shrunken balloon has a small amount of light blue liquid in it, as well as some snow-like crystals. As it warms up, the liquid boils, and part of the crystals sublimate, with some crystals lingering for awhile and then producing a liquid. Identify the blue liquid and the two solids in the cold balloon. Justify your identifications using data from Table 14.2.

# 14.5 Conduction

20. Some electric stoves have a flat ceramic surface with heating elements hidden beneath. A pot placed over a heating element will be heated, while it is safe to touch the surface only a few centimeters away.

3. To sterilize a $5 0 . 0 \mathrm { - g }$ glass baby bottle, we must raise its temperature from $2 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $9 5 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . How much heat transfer is required?   
4. The same heat transfer into identical masses of different substances produces different temperature changes. Calculate the final temperature when $1 . 0 0 \ k \mathtt { c a l }$ of heat transfers into $\displaystyle 1 . 0 0 \ k \ g$ of the following, originally at $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ : (a) water; (b) concrete; (c) steel; and (d) mercury.   
5. Rubbing your hands together warms them by converting work into thermal energy.

The mass of tissues warmed is only $0 . 1 0 0 { \sf k g }$ , mostly in the palms and fingers.   
6. A 0.250-kg block of a pure material is heated from $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $6 5 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ by the addition of $4 . 3 5 \mathsf { k } \mathsf { ] }$ of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed.   
7. Suppose identical amounts of heat transfer into different masses of copper and water, causing identical changes in temperature. What is the ratio of the mass of copper to water?   
8. (a) The number of kilocalories in food is determined by calorimetry techniques in which the food is burned and the amount of heat transfer is measured. How many kilocalories per gram are there in a $5 . 0 0 \mathrm { - g }$ peanut if the energy from burning it is transferred to $0 . 5 0 0 \mathsf { k g }$ of water held in a $0 . 1 0 0 \mathrm { - } \mathrm { k g }$ aluminum cup, causing a $5 4 . 9 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ temperature increase? (b) Compare your answer to labeling information found on a package of peanuts and comment on whether the values are consistent.

9. Following vigorous exercise, the body temperature of an $8 0 . 0 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { k g }$ person is $4 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . At what rate in watts must the person transfer thermal energy to reduce the the body temperature to $3 7 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in 30.0 min, assuming the body continues to produce energy at the rate of 150 W? (1 watt $= 1$ joule/second or $1 \mathrm { W } = 1 \mathrm { J / s }$ .

10. Even when shut down after a period of normal use, a large commercial nuclear reactor transfers thermal energy at the rate of 150 MW by the radioactive decay of fission products. This heat transfer causes a rapid increase in temperature if the cooling system fails (1 watt $= 1$ joule/second or $\mathsf { 1 } \mathsf { W } = \mathsf { 1 } \mathsf { J } / \mathsf { s }$ and $\mathsf { 1 } \mathsf { M } \mathsf { W } = \mathsf { 1 }$ megawatt).

(The initial rate of temperature increase would be greater than that calculated here because the heat transfer is concentrated in a smaller mass. Later, however, the temperature increase would slow down because the $5 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ steel containment vessel would also begin to heat up.)

# 14.3 Phase Change and Latent Heat

(b) How long does this take if the rate of heat transfer is 500 W 1 watt $= 1$ joule/second $( 1 ~ \mathrm { W } = 1 ~ \mathrm { J / s } )$ ?   
14. The formation of condensation on a glass of ice water causes the ice to melt faster than it would otherwise.

74. Integrated Concepts (a) What is the temperature increase of water falling $5 5 . 0 \mathsf { m }$ over Niagara Falls? (b) What fraction must evaporate to keep the temperature constant?

75. Integrated Concepts Hot air rises because it has expanded. It then displaces a greater volume of cold air, which increases the buoyant force on it. (a) Calculate the ratio of the buoyant force to the weight of $5 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ air surrounded by $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ air. (b) What energy is needed to cause $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ of air to go from $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ to $5 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ?$ (c) What gravitational potential energy is gained by this volume of air if it rises $\mathsf { 1 . 0 0 } \mathsf { m ? }$ Will this cause a significant cooling of the air?

76. Unreasonable Results (a) What is the temperature increase of an $8 0 . 0 \mathsf { k g }$ person who consumes 2500 kcal of food in one day with $9 5 . 0 \%$ of the energy transferred as heat to the body? (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which premise or assumption is responsible?

77. Unreasonable Results An Arctic inventor surrounded by ice thinks it would be much less mechanically complex to cool a car engine by melting ice on it than by having a water-cooled system with a radiator, water pump, antifreeze, and so on. (a) If $8 0 . 0 \%$ of the energy in 1.00 gal of gasoline is converted into “waste heat” in a car engine, how many kilograms of $0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ice could it melt? (b) Is this a reasonable amount of ice to carry around to cool the engine for 1.00 gal of gasoline consumption? (c) What premises or assumptions are unreasonable?

78. Unreasonable Results

(a) Calculate the rate of heat transfer by conduction through a window with an area of $1 . 0 0 \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ that is 0.750 cm thick, if its inner surface is at $2 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and its outer surface is at $3 5 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which premise or assumption is responsible?

79. Unreasonable Results A meteorite $\mathtt { 1 . 2 0 \mathtt { c m } }$ in diameter is so hot immediately after penetrating the atmosphere that it radiates $2 0 . 0 \mathsf { k W }$ of power. (a) What is its temperature, if the surroundings are at $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and it has an emissivity of 0.800? (b) What is unreasonable about this result? (c) Which premise or assumption is responsible?

80. Construct Your Own Problem Consider a new model of commercial airplane having its brakes tested as a part of the initial flight permission procedure. The airplane is brought to takeoff speed and then stopped with the brakes alone. Construct a problem in which you calculate the temperature increase of the brakes during this process. You may assume most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to thermal energy in the brakes and surrounding materials, and that little escapes. Note that the brakes are expected to become so hot in this procedure that they ignite and, in order to pass the test, the airplane must be able to withstand the fire for some time without a general conflagration.

81. Construct Your Own Problem Consider a person outdoors on a cold night. Construct a problem in which you calculate the rate of heat transfer from the person by all three heat transfer methods. Make the initial circumstances such that at rest the person will have a net heat transfer and then decide how much physical activity of a chosen type is necessary to balance the rate of heat transfer. Among the things to consider are the size of the person, type of clothing, initial metabolic rate, sky conditions, amount of water evaporated, and volume of air breathed. Of course, there are many other factors to consider and your instructor may wish to guide you in the assumptions made as well as the detail of analysis and method of presenting your results.
