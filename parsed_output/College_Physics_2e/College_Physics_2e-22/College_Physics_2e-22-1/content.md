# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Describe the difference between the north and south poles of a magnet.   
• Describe how magnetic poles interact with each other. All magnets attract iron, such as that in a refrigerator door. However, magnets may attract or repel other magnets.   
Experimentation shows that all magnets have two poles. If freely suspended, one pole will point toward the north.



The two poles are thus named the north magnetic pole and the south magnetic pole (or more properly, northseeking and south-seeking poles, for the attractions in those directions).

# Universal Characteristics of Magnets and Magnetic Poles

It is a universal characteristic of all magnets that likepolesrepelandunlikepolesatract. (Note the similarity with electrostatics: unlike charges attract and like charges repel.)

Further experimentation shows that it is impos ibletoseparatenorthandsouthpolesin the manner that $^ +$ and − charges can be separated.

# Misconception Alert: Earth’s Magnetic Poles

Earth acts like a very large bar magnet with its south-seeking pole near the geographic North Pole. That is why the north pole of your compass is attracted toward the geographic north pole of Earth—because the magnetic pole that is near the geographic North Pole is actually a south magnetic pole! Confusion arises because the geographic term “North Pole” has come to be used (incorrectly) for the magnetic pole that is near the North Pole. Thus, “north magnetic pole” is actually a misnomer—it should be called the south magnetic pole.

The fact that magnetic poles always occur in pairs of north and south is true from the very large scale—for example, sunspots always occur in pairs that are north and south magnetic poles—all the way down to the very small scale. Magnetic atoms have both a north pole and a south pole, as do many types of subatomic particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons.

# Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Refrigerator Magnets

We know that like magnetic poles repel and unlike poles attract. See if you can show this for two refrigerator magnets. Will the magnets stick if you turn them over? Why do they stick to the door anyway? What can you say about the magnetic properties of the door next to the magnet? Do refrigerator magnets stick to metal or plastic spoons? Do they stick to all types of metal?
