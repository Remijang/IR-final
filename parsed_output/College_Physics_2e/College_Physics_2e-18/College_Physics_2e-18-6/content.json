Changes in electrical properties are also essential in core biological processes.

In one key experiment, Just established that the egg membrane undergoes a depolarizing \"wave of negativity\" the moment it fuses with a sperm cell. This change in charge is now known as the \"fast block\" that ensures that only one sperm cell fuses with an egg cell and is critical for embryonic development. ",
