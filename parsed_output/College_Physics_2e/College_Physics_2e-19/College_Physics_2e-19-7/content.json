How does the polar character of water molecules help to explain water\u2019s relatively large dielectric constant? (Figure 19.18)   \n18. Sparks will occur between the plates of an airfilled capacitor at lower voltage when the air is humid than when dry. Explain why, considering the polar character of water molecules.   \n19. Water has a large dielectric constant, but it is rarely used in capacitors. Explain why.   \n20. Membranes in living cells, including those in humans, are characterized by a separation of charge across the membrane. Effectively, the membranes are thus charged capacitors with important functions related to the potential difference across the membrane. Is energy required to separate these charges in living membranes and, if so, is its source the metabolization of food energy or some other source? ",
