A thermal hazard is one where excessive electric power causes undesired thermal effects, such as starting a fire in the wall of a house. A shock hazard occurs when electric current passes through a person. Shocks range in severity from painful, but otherwise harmless, to heartstopping lethality. This section considers these hazards and the various factors affecting them in a quantitative manner.

A classic example of this is the short circuit, a low-resistance path between terminals of a voltage source. An example of a short circuit is shown in Figure 20.18. Insulation on wires leading to an appliance has worn through, allowing the two wires to come into contact. Such an undesired contact with a high voltage is called a short. Since the resistance of the short, $r$ , is very small, the power dissipated in the short, $P = V ^ { 2 } / r ,$ is very large. For example, if $V$ is $\\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { 1 2 0 } } \\boldsymbol { \\mathsf { V } }$ and $r$ is $0 . 1 0 0 \\Omega$ , then the power is 144 kW, muchgreater than that used by a typical household appliance. Thermal energy delivered at this rate will very quickly raise the temperature of surrounding materials, melting or perhaps igniting them. ",

This can happen if the short creates ionization. These charged atoms and molecules are free to move and, thus, lower the resistance $r$ . Since $P = V ^ { 2 } / r$ , the power dissipated in the short rises, possibly causing more ionization, more power, and so on. High voltages, such as the 480-V AC used in some industrial applications, lend themselves to this hazard, because higher voltages create higher initial power production in a short. ",

        "text": "Another serious, but less dramatic, thermal hazard occurs when wires supplying power to a user are overloaded with too great a current. As discussed in the previous section, the power dissipated in the supply wires is $P = I ^ { 2 } R _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ , where $R _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ is the resistance of the wires and $I$ the current flowing through them. If either $I$ or $R _ { \\mathrm { w } }$ is too large, the wires overheat. For example, a worn appliance cord (with some of its braided wires broken) may have $R _ { \\mathrm { w } } = 2 . 0 0 \\Omega$ rather than the $0 . 1 0 0 \\Omega$ it should be. If 10.0 A of current passes through the cord, then $P = I ^ { 2 } R _ { \\mathrm { w } } = 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { W }$ is dissipated in the cord\u2014much more than is safe. Similarly, if a wire with a $0 . 1 0 0 \\textrm { - } \\Omega$ resistance is meant to carry a few amps, but is instead carrying $\\mathtt { 1 0 0 A }$ , it will severely overheat. The power dissipated in the wire will in that case be $P = 1 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { W } }$ . Fuses and circuit breakers are used to limit excessive currents. (See Figure 20.19 and Figure 20.20.)

Large circuit breakers found in power-distribution systems employ insulating gas and even use jets of gas to blow out such sparks.

A great number of safety rules take the 5-mA value for the maximum allowed shock. At 10 to $2 0 ~ \\mathsf { m A }$ and above, the current can stimulate sustained muscular contractions much as regular nerve impulses do. People sometimes say they were knocked across the room by a shock, but what really happened was that certain muscles contracted, propelling them in a manner not of their own choosing.

The muscles that close the fingers are stronger than those that open them, so the hand closes involuntarily on the wire shocking it. This can prolong the shock indefinitely. It can also be a danger to a person trying to rescue the victim, because the rescuer\u2019s hand may close about the victim\u2019s wrist. Usually the best way to help the victim is to give the fist a hard knock/blow/ jar with an insulator or to throw an insulator at the fist.

For example, the heart is unaffected by an electric shock through the brain, such as may be used to treat manic depression. And it is a general truth that the longer the duration of a shock, the greater its effects. Figure 20.22 presents a graph that illustrates the effects of frequency on a shock. The curves show the minimum current for two different effects, as a function of frequency. The lower the current needed, the more sensitive the body is at that frequency. Ironically, the body is most sensitive to frequencies near the 50- or $6 0 - H z$ frequencies in common use. The body is slightly less sensitive for DC $( f = 0 )$ ), mildly confirming Edison\u2019s claims that AC presents a greater hazard. At higher and higher frequencies, the body becomes progressively less sensitive to any effects that involve nerves. This is related to the maximum rates at which nerves can fire or be stimulated. At very high frequencies, electrical current travels only on the surface of a person. Thus a wart can be burned off with very high frequency current without causing the heart to stop. (Do not try this at home with $6 0 \\mathrm { - } \\mathsf { H z } \\mathsf { A C l } ;$ ) Some of the spectacular demonstrations of electricity, in which high-voltage arcs are passed through the air and over people\u2019s bodies, employ high frequencies and low currents.
