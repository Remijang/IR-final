Each point on the wavefront emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed $v$ . These are drawn at a time later, so that they have moved a distance $s = v t$ . The new wavefront is a line tangent to the wavelets and is where we would expect the wave to be a time $t$ later. Huygens\u2019s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. We will find it useful not only in describing how light waves propagate, but also in explaining the laws of reflection and refraction. In addition, we will see that Huygens\u2019s principle tells us how and where light rays interfere. ",

Each wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wavefront crossed the interface between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the waves do not travel as far in a given time, and the new wavefront changes direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes direction to become closer to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell\u2019s law can be derived from the geometry in Figure 27.7, but this is left as an exercise for ambitious readers. ",

For light, we expect to see a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and we expect no light to bend around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, we expect to hear it everywhere in the room and, thus, expect that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening (see Figure 27.8). What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that light has very short wavelengths and acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door and bends around corners (for frequency of $1 0 0 0 { \\mathsf { H z } }$ , $\\lambda = c / f = ( 3 3 0 \\mathrm { m / s } ) / ( 1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } ) = 0 . 3 3 \\mathrm { m }$ , about three times smaller than the width of the doorway).
