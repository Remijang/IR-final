Tube 1 is open at the end facing the flow. A dead spot having zero speed is created there. Tube 2 has an opening on the side, and so the fluid has a speed $v$ across the opening; thus, pressure there drops. The difference in pressure at the manometer is $\\mathrm { ~ \\bar { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } } \\rho v _ { 2 } ^ { 2 }$ , and so $h$ is proportional to $\\scriptstyle { \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } { \\dot { \\rho } } v _ { 2 } ^ { 2 }$ .
