Examples come easily\u2014a column of smoke rises from a camp fire, water streams from a fire hose, blood courses through your veins. Why does rising smoke curl and twist? How does a nozzle increase the speed of water emerging from a hose? How does the body regulate blood flow? The physics of fluids in motion\u2014fluid dynamics\u2014allows us to answer these and many other questions. ",
