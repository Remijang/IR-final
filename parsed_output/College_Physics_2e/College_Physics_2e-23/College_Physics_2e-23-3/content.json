        "text": "Motional emfs in the Earth\u2019s weak magnetic field are not ordinarily very large, or we would notice voltage along metal rods, such as a screwdriver, during ordinary motions. For example, a simple calculation of the motional emf of a 1 m rod moving at $3 . 0 \\mathsf { m } / \\mathsf { s }$ perpendicular to the Earth\u2019s field gives $\\mathrm { e m f } = B \\ell v = ( 5 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\ \\mathrm { T ) ( 1 . 0 \\ m ) ( 3 . 0 \\ m / s ) = 1 5 0 \\ \\mu V } .$ This small value is consistent with experience. There is a spectacular exception, however. In 1992 and 1996, attempts were made with the space shuttle to create large motional emfs. The Tethered Satellite was to be let out on a $2 0 \\ k \\mathsf { m }$ length of wire as shown in Figure 23.11, to create a $5 \\mathsf { k V }$ emf by moving at orbital speed through the Earth\u2019s field. This emf could be used to convert some of the shuttle\u2019s kinetic and potential energy into electrical energy if a complete circuit could be made. To complete the circuit, the stationary ionosphere was to supply a return path for the current to flow. (The ionosphere is the rarefied and partially ionized atmosphere at orbital altitudes. It conducts because of the ionization. The ionosphere serves the same function as the stationary rails and connecting resistor in Figure 23.10, without which there would not be a complete circuit.) Drag on the current in the cable due to the magnetic force $F = I \\ell B$ sin $\\theta$ does the work that reduces the shuttle\u2019s kinetic and potential energy and allows it to be converted to electrical energy. The tests were both unsuccessful. In the first, the cable hung up and could only be extended a couple of hundred meters; in the second, the cable broke when almost fully extended. Example 23.2 indicates feasibility in principle. ",
