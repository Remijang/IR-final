When the switch is closed, a magnetic field is produced in the coil on the top part of the iron ring and transmitted to the coil on the bottom part of the ring. The galvanometer is used to detect any current induced in the coil on the bottom. It was found that each time the switch is closed, the galvanometer detects a current in one direction in the coil on the bottom. (You can also observe this in a physics lab.) Each time the switch is opened, the galvanometer detects a current in the opposite direction. Interestingly, if the switch remains closed or open for any length of time, there is no current through the galvanometer. Closingandopeningtheswitchinduces the current. It is the changein magnetic field that creates the current. More basic than the current that flows is the emfthat causes it. The current is a result of an emfinducedbyachangingmagneticfield, whether or not there is a path for current to flow. ",
