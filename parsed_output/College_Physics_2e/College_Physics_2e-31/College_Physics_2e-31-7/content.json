        "text": "The answer was supplied in 1928 by the Russian physicist George Gamow (1904\u20131968). The $\\alpha$ particle tunnels through a region of space it is forbidden to be in, and it comes out of the side of the nucleus. Like an electron making a transition between orbits around an atom, it travels from one point to another without ever having been in between. Figure 31.28 indicates how this works. The wave function of a quantum mechanical particle varies smoothly, going from within an atomic nucleus (on one side of a potential energy barrier) to outside the nucleus (on the other side of the potential energy barrier). Inside the barrier, the wave function does not become zero but decreases exponentially, and we do not observe the particle inside the barrier. The probability of finding a particle is related to the square of its wave function, and so there is a small probability of finding the particle outside the barrier, which implies that the particle can tunnel through the barrier. This process is called barrier penetration or quantum mechanical tunneling. This concept was developed in theory by J. Robert Oppenheimer (who led the development of the first nuclear bombs during World War II) and was used by Gamow and others to describe $\\alpha$ decay. ",

Outside the barrier, the wave function is small but finite, and there it smoothly becomes sinusoidal.

In addition to qualitatively explaining how the four nucleons in an $\\alpha$ particle can get out of the nucleus, the detailed theory also explains quantitatively the half-life of various nuclei that undergo $\\alpha$ decay. This description is what Gamow and others devised, and it works for $\\alpha$ decay half-lives that vary by 17 orders of magnitude. Experiments have shown that the more energetic the $\\alpha$ decay of a particular nuclide is, the shorter is its half-life. Tunneling explains this in the following manner: For the decay to be more energetic, the nucleons must have more energy in the nucleus and should be able to ascend a little closer to the rim. The barrier is therefore not as thick for more energetic decay, and the exponential decrease of the wave function inside the barrier is not as great. Thus the probability of finding the particle outside the barrier is greater, and the half-life is shorter. ",
