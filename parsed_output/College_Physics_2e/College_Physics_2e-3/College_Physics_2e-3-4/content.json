This fact was discussed in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction, where vertical and horizontal motions were seen to be independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to break it into two motions, one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most sensible, because acceleration due to gravity is vertical\u2014thus, there will be no acceleration along the horizontal axis when air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the $x$ -axis and the vertical axis the y-axis. Figure 3.34 illustrates the notation for displacement, where is defined to be the total displacement and $\\mathbf { x }$ and are its components along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors are s, $x ,$ , and $y .$ (Note that in the last section we used the notation to represent a vector with components $\\mathbf { A } _ { x }$ and $\\mathbf { A } _ { y }$ . If we continued this format, we would call displacement with components $\\mathbf { s } _ { x }$ and ${ \\bf s } _ { y }$ .

Often, it is convenient to choose the initial position of the object as the origin such that $x _ { 0 } = 0$ and $y _ { 0 } = 0$ . It is also important to define the positive and negative directions in the $x$ and $y$ directions. Typically, we define the positive vertical direction as upwards, and the positive horizontal direction is usually the direction of the object\u2019s motion. When this is the case, the vertical acceleration, $g$ , takes a negative value (since it is directed downwards towards the Earth). However, it is occasionally useful to define the coordinates differently. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of a ball thrown downwards from the top of a cliff, it may make sense to define the positive direction downwards since the motion of the ball is solely in the downwards direction. If this is the case, $g$ takes a positive value. ",
