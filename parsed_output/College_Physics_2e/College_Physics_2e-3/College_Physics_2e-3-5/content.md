# 3.5 Addition of Velocities

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Apply principles of vector addition to determine relative velocity.   
• Explain the significance of the observer in the measurement of velocity.

# Relative Velocity

If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves diagonalyrelative to the shore, as in Figure 3.40. The boat does not move in the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course, is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small airplane flies overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is pointed, as illustrated in Figure 3.41. The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement of the air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways.

In each of these situations, an object has a velocity relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground. The velocity of the object relativetotheobserveris the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.40 and Figure 3.41. These situations are only two of many in which it is useful to add velocities. In this module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity means.

How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude and direction); the rules of vector addition discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods apply to the addition of velocities, just as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the addition of velocities is simple—they add like ordinary numbers. For example, if a field hockey player is moving at $5 \mathrm { m / s }$ straight toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a velocity of $3 0 \mathrm { m / s }$ relative to her body, then the velocity of the ball is $3 5 \mathrm { m / s }$ relative to the stationary, profusely sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal.

In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can be used to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques. The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude and direction of velocity ( $\dot { v }$ and $\theta$ ) and its components $\{ v _ { x }$ and $v _ { y }$ ) along the $x -$ and y-axes of an appropriately chosen coordinate system:



$$
\begin{array} { r } { v _ { x } = v \cos \theta } \\ { v _ { y } = v \sin \theta } \end{array}
$$

$$
v = \sqrt { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } }
$$

$$
\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } ) .
$$

These equations are valid for any vectors and are adapted specifically for velocity. The first two equations are used to find the components of a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are used to find the magnitude and direction of velocity when its components are known.

# Take-Home Experiment: Relative Velocity of a Boat

Fill a bathtub half-full of water. Take a toy boat or some other object that floats in water. Unplug the drain so water starts to drain. Try pushing the boat from one side of the tub to the other and perpendicular to the flow of water. Which way do you need to push the boat so that it ends up immediately opposite? Compare the directions of the flow of water, heading of the boat, and actual velocity of the boat.

# EXAMPLE 3.6

# Adding Velocities: A Boat on a River

Refer to Figure 3.43, which shows a boat trying to go straight across the river. Let us calculate the magnitude and direction of the boat’s velocity relative to an observer on the shore, $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { t o t } }$ . The velocity of the boat, $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { b o a t } }$ , is $0 . 7 5 ~ \mathsf { m / s }$ in the $y$ -direction relative to the river and the velocity of the river, $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { r i v e r } }$ , is $1 . 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ to the right.

# Strategy

We start by choosing a coordinate system with its $x$ -axis parallel to the velocity of the river, as shown in Figure 3.43. Because the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to the water is parallel to the $y$ -axis and perpendicular to the velocity of the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations $v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = \sqrt { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } }$ and $\theta = \mathrm { t a n } ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } )$ directly.

# Solution

The magnitude of the total velocity is

$$
v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = \sqrt { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } } ,
$$

where

$$
v _ { x } = v _ { \mathrm { r i v e r } } = 1 . 2 0 \mathrm { m / s }
$$

and

$$
v _ { y } = v _ { \mathrm { b o a t } } = 0 . 7 5 0 \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

Thus,

$$
v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = { \sqrt { \left( 1 . 2 0 \ { \mathrm { m / s } } \right) ^ { 2 } + ( 0 . 7 5 0 \ { \mathrm { m / s } } ) ^ { 2 } } }
$$

yielding

$$
v _ { \mathrm { { t o t } } } = 1 . 4 2 \ : \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

The direction of the total velocity $\theta$ is given by:

$$
\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } ) { = } \tan ^ { - 1 } ( 0 . 7 5 0 / 1 . 2 0 ) .
$$

This equation gives

$$
\theta = 3 2 . 0 ^ { \circ } .
$$

# Discussion

Both the magnitude $v$ and the direction $\theta$ of the total velocity are consistent with Figure 3.43. Note that because the velocity of the river is large compared with the velocity of the boat, it is swept rapidly downstream. This result is evidenced by the small angle (only $3 2 . 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } } )$ ) the total velocity has relative to the riverbank.

# EXAMPLE 3.7

# Calculating Velocity: Wind Velocity Causes an Airplane to Drift

Calculate the wind velocity for the situation shown in Figure 3.44. The plane is known to be moving at $4 5 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m } / \mathsf { s }$ due north relative to the air mass, while its velocity relative to the ground (its total velocity) is $3 8 . 0 ~ \mathsf { m } / \mathsf { s }$ in a direction $2 0 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ west of north.

# Strategy

In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know the total velocity $\mathbf { v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } }$ and that it is the sum of two other velocities, ${ \bf v _ { \mathrm { w } } }$ (the wind) and $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ (the plane relative to the air mass). The quantity $\mathbf { v _ { \mathrm { p } } }$ is known, and we are asked to find ${ \bf v _ { \mathrm { w } } }$ . None of the velocities are perpendicular, but it is possible to find their components along a common set of perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of ${ \bf v _ { \mathrm { w } } }$ , then we can combine them to solve for its magnitude and direction. As shown in Figure 3.44, we choose a coordinate system with its $x$ -axis due east and its y-axis due north (parallel to $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ ). (You may wish to look back at the discussion of the addition of vectors using perpendicular components in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)

# Solution

Because $\mathbf { v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } }$ is the vector sum of the ${ \bf v _ { \mathrm { w } } }$ and $\mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { p } }$ , its $x -$ and y-components are the sums of the $x -$ and y-components of the wind and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of velocity so $v _ { \mathrm { p } x } = 0$ and

. That is,

$$
v _ { \mathrm { t o t } x } = v _ { \mathrm { w } x }
$$

and

$$
v _ { \mathrm { t o t } y } = v _ { \mathrm { w } y } + v _ { \mathrm { p } } .
$$

We can use the first of these two equations to find ${ v } _ { \mathrm { w } x }$ :

$$
v _ { \mathrm { w } x } = v _ { \mathrm { t o t } x } = v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } \mathrm { c o s } ~ 1 1 0 ^ { \circ } .
$$

Because $v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } = 3 8 . 0  { \mathrm { m / s } }$ and $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } = - 0 . 3 4 2$ we have

$$
v _ { \mathrm { w } x } = ( 3 8 . 0 \mathrm { m / s } ) ( - 0 . 3 4 2 ) = - 1 3 \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

The minus sign indicates motion west which is consistent with the diagram.

Now, to find $v _ { \mathrm { w } y }$ we note that

$$
v _ { \mathrm { t o t } y } = v _ { \mathrm { w } y } + v _ { \mathrm { p } }
$$

Here $v _ { \mathrm { t o t } y } = v _ { \mathrm { t o t } } \sin { 1 1 0 ^ { \circ } }$ ; thus,

$$
v _ { \mathrm { w } y } = ( 3 8 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s } ) ( 0 . 9 4 0 ) - 4 5 . 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s } = - 9 . 2 9 ~ \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

This minus sign indicates motion south which is consistent with the diagram.

Now that the perpendicular components of the wind velocity ${ v } _ { \mathrm { w } x }$ and $v _ { \mathrm { W } y }$ are known, we can find the magnitude and direction of ${ \bf v _ { \mathrm { w } } }$ . First, the magnitude is

$$
\begin{array} { l l l } { v _ { \mathrm { w } } } & { = } & { \sqrt { v _ { \mathrm { w } x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { \mathrm { w } y } ^ { 2 } } } \\ & { = } & { \sqrt { ( - 1 3 . 0 \mathrm { m / s } ) ^ { 2 } + ( - 9 . 2 9 \mathrm { m / s } ) ^ { 2 } } } \end{array}
$$

so that

$$
v _ { \mathrm { w } } = 1 6 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

The direction is:

$$
\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { \mathrm { w } y } / v _ { \mathrm { w } x } ) { = } \tan ^ { - 1 } ( - 9 . 2 9 / - 1 3 . 0 )
$$

giving

$$
\theta = 3 5 . 6 ^ { \circ } .
$$

# Discussion

The wind’s speed and direction are consistent with the significant effect the wind has on the total velocity of the plane, as seen in Figure 3.44. Because the plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity relative to the air mass as well as heading in a different direction.

Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing an appropriate coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate system with one axis parallel to gravity.

# Relative Velocities and Classical Relativity

When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the velocityisrelativetosomereferenceframe. These velocities are called relative velocities. For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers (which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity, which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon.

Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it with Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his moderntheory of relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical relativity, first discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speeds are less than about $1 \%$ of the speed of light—that is, less than $3 { , } 0 0 0 \mathrm { k m / s }$ . Most things we encounter in daily life move slower than this speed.

Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a mast on a moving ship drops their binoculars. Where will it hit the deck? Will it hit at the base of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance is negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a point directly below its point of release. Now let us consider what two different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight down the mast. (See Figure 3.45.) To the observer on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the same horizontal velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars are falling. This observer sees the curved path shown in Figure 3.45. Although the paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it. To get the correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the velocities relative to the observer.

# EXAMPLE 3.8

# Calculating Relative Velocity: An Airline Passenger Drops a Coin

An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ . What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m }$ below its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane? (b) Measured relative to the Earth?

# Strategy

Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object (one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial velocity is $2 6 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is best to use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes.

# Solution for (a)

Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and position are zero, and the final position is $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m }$ . The final velocity can be found using the equation:

$$
{ v _ { y } } ^ { 2 } = { v _ { 0 , y } } ^ { 2 } - 2 g ( y - y _ { 0 } ) .
$$

Substituting known values into the equation, we get

$$
v _ { y } ^ { 2 } = 0 ^ { 2 } - 2 ( 9 . 8 0 \mathrm { m / s ^ { 2 } } ) ( - 1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m } - 0 . \mathrm { m } ) = 2 9 . 4 \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { s } ^ { 2 }
$$

yielding

$$
v _ { y } = - 5 . 4 2 \mathrm { m / s } .
$$

We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42 and -5.42. We choose the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards. There is no initial horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to the plane.

# Solution for (b)

Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical velocity for the coin relative to the ground is $v _ { y } = - 5 . 4 2 \mathrm { m / s }$ , the same as found in part (a). In contrast to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity. However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial and final horizontal velocities are the same and $v _ { x } = 2 6 0 \mathrm { m / s }$ . The $x -$ and y-components of velocity can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity:

$$
v = \sqrt { { v _ { x } } ^ { 2 } + { v _ { y } } ^ { 2 } } .
$$

Thus,

$$
v = { \sqrt { ( 2 6 0 ~ { \mathrm { m / s } } ) ^ { 2 } + ( - 5 . 4 2 ~ { \mathrm { m / s } } ) ^ { 2 } } }
$$

yielding

$$
v = 2 6 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s } .
$$

The direction is given by:

$$
\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } ) = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( - 5 . 4 2 / 2 6 0 )
$$

so that

$$
\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( - 0 . 0 2 0 8 ) = - 1 . 1 9 ^ { \circ } .
$$

# Discussion

In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m }$ . This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way when the plane is flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an observer on the ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary numbers—the final velocity v in part (b) is not $( 2 6 0 - 5 . 4 2 ) \mathrm { m } / \mathrm { s }$ ; rather, it is $2 6 0 . 0 6 \mathrm { m / s }$ . The velocity’s magnitude had to be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed for the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see verydifferent paths. (See Figure 3.46.) In addition, both observers see the coin fall $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { m }$ vertically, but the one on the ground also sees it move forward $\mathtt { 1 4 4 m }$ (this calculation is left for the reader). Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly horizontal path.

# Making Connections: Relativity and Einstein

Because Einstein was able to clearly define how measurements are made (some involve light) and because the speed of light is the same for all observers, the outcomes are spectacularly unexpected. Time varies with observer, energy is stored as increased mass, and more surprises await.

# Section Summary

# 3.1 Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction

• The shortest path between any two points is a straight line. In two dimensions, this path can be represented by a vector with horizontal and vertical components. • The horizontal and vertical components of a vector are independent of one another. Motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.

# 3.2 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods

• The graphical method of adding vectors and involves drawing vectors on a graph and adding them using the head-to-tail method. The resultant vector is defined such that $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B } = \mathbf { R }$ . The magnitude and direction of $\mathbf { R }$ are then determined with a ruler and protractor, respectively.   
• The graphical method of subtracting vector from involves adding the opposite of vector , which is defined as $- \mathbf { B }$ . In this case, $\mathbf { A } { - } \mathbf { B } = \mathbf { A } { + } ( - \mathbf { B } ) = \mathbf { R }$ . Then, the head-to-tail method of addition is followed in the usual way to obtain the resultant vector .   
• Addition of vectors is commutative such that $\mathbf { A } + \mathbf { B } = \mathbf { B } + \mathbf { A }$ . The head-to-tail method of adding vectors involves drawing the first vector on a graph and then placing the tail of each subsequent vector at the head of the previous vector. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the final vector.   
• If a vector is multiplied by a scalar quantity $c$ , the magnitude of the product is given by $c A$ . If $c$ is positive, the direction of the product points in the same direction as ; if $c$ is negative, the direction of the product points in the opposite direction as .



# 3.3 Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods

• The analytical method of vector addition and subtraction involves using the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric identities to determine the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector.   
• The steps to add vectors and using the analytical method are as follows: Step 1: Determine the coordinate system for the vectors. Then, determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector using the equations   
$\begin{array} { r c l } { { A _ { x } } } & { { = } } & { { A \cos \theta } } \\ { { B _ { x } } } & { { = } } & { { B \cos \theta } } \\ { { \mathrm { a n d } } } & { { } } & { { } } \\ { { A _ { y } } } & { { = } } & { { A \sin \theta } } \\ { { B _ { y } } } & { { = } } & { { B \sin \theta . } } \end{array}$   
Step 2: Add the horizontal and vertical   
components of each vector to determine the   
components $R _ { x }$ and $R _ { y }$ of the resultant vector, :   
$R _ { x } = A _ { x } + B _ { x }$   
and   
$\begin{array} { r } { R _ { y } = A _ { y } + B _ { y } . } \end{array}$   
Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine   
the magnitude, $R$ , of the resultant vector $\mathbf { R }$ :   
$R = \sqrt { R _ { x } ^ { 2 } + R _ { y } ^ { 2 } } .$   
Step 4: Use a trigonometric identity to determine   
the direction, $\theta _ { ; }$ , of $\mathbf { R }$ :   
$\theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( R _ { y } / R _ { x } ) .$



# 3.4 Projectile Motion

• Projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity. • To solve projectile motion problems, perform the following steps:   
1. Determine a coordinate system. Then, resolve the position and/or velocity of the object in the horizontal and vertical components. The components of position are given by the quantities $x$ and $y$ , and the components of the velocity $\mathbf { v }$ are given by $v _ { x } = v$ cos $\theta$ and $v _ { y } = v$ sin $\theta$ , where $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity and $\theta$ is its direction.   
2. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal direction using the following equations: Horizontal motion $( a _ { x } = 0 )$ )

$x = x _ { 0 } + v _ { x } t$

$v _ { x } = v _ { 0 x } = \mathbf { v } _ { \mathrm { x } } =$ velocity is a constant. 3. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the vertical direction using the following equations: Vertical Motion (assuming positive is up $\begin{array} { r l } & { a _ { y } = - g = - 9 . 8 0 \mathrm { m / s ^ { 2 } } ) } \\ & { y = y _ { 0 } + \cfrac { 1 } { 2 } ( v _ { 0 y } + v _ { y } ) t } \\ & { v _ { y } = v _ { 0 y } - g t } \\ & { y = y _ { 0 } + v _ { 0 y } t - \cfrac { 1 } { 2 } g t ^ { 2 } } \\ & { v _ { y } ^ { 2 } = v _ { 0 y } ^ { 2 } - 2 g ( y - y _ { 0 } ) . } \end{array}$ 4. Recombine the horizontal and vertical components of location and/or velocity using the following equations: $\begin{array} { r l } & { s = \sqrt { x ^ { 2 } + y ^ { 2 } } } \\ & { \theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( y / x ) } \\ & { v = \sqrt { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } } } \\ & { \theta _ { \mathrm { v } } = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } ) . } \end{array}$ • The maximum height $h$ of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity $v _ { 0 y }$ is given by $h = \frac { v _ { 0 y } ^ { 2 } } { 2 g } .$ The maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. The range $R$ of a projectile on level ground launched at an angle $\theta _ { 0 }$ above the horizontal with initial speed $v _ { 0 }$ is given by $R = \frac { v _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \sin 2 \theta _ { 0 } } { g } .$

# 3.5 Addition of Velocities

• Velocities in two dimensions are added using the same analytical vector techniques, which are rewritten as $\begin{array} { r l } & { v _ { x } = v \cos \theta } \\ & { v _ { y } = v \sin \theta } \\ & { v = \sqrt { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } } } \\ & { \theta = \tan ^ { - 1 } ( v _ { y } / v _ { x } ) . } \end{array}$ Relative velocity is the velocity of an object as observed from a particular reference frame, and it varies dramatically with reference frame.   
• Relativity is the study of how different observers measure the same phenomenon, particularly when the observers move relative to one another. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speed is less than about $1 \%$ of the speed of light $( 3 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k m / s } )$ .

(b) When is the velocity a minimum? A maximum?

Its position at that time is $4 . 0 0 \mathrm { m }$ west and $\mathtt { 1 2 . 0 m }$ above the center of the $3 0 . 0 \mathsf { c m }$ diameter nest.

(Although the maximum distance for a projectile on level ground is achieved at $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ when air resistance is neglected, the actual angle to achieve maximum range is smaller; thus, $3 8 ^ { \circ }$ will give a longer range than $4 5 ^ { \circ }$ in the shot put.)

You should obtain an equation of the form $y = a x + b x ^ { 2 }$ where $a$ and $b$ are constants.

(d) If such a muzzle velocity could be obtained, discuss the effects of air resistance, thinning air with altitude, and the curvature of the Earth on the range of the super cannon.

51. Construct Your Own Problem Consider a ball tossed over a fence. Construct a problem in which you calculate the ball’s needed initial velocity to just clear the fence. Among the things to determine are; the height of the fence, the distance to the fence from the point of release of the ball, and the height at which the ball is released. You should also consider whether it is possible to choose the initial speed for the ball and just calculate the angle at which it is thrown. Also examine the possibility of multiple solutions given the distances and heights you have chosen.

63. The great astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies are receding from our Milky Way Galaxy with velocities proportional to their distances. It appears to an observer on the Earth that we are at the center of an expanding universe.

Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities: (a) relative to galaxy 2 and (b) relative to galaxy 5. The results mean that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of expansion with the given information.

FIGURE 3.59 Five galaxies on a straight line, showing their distances and velocities relative to the Milky Way (MW) Galaxy. The distances are in millions of light years (Mly), where a light year is the distance light travels in one year. The velocities are nearly proportional to the distances. The sizes of the galaxies are greatly exaggerated; an average galaxy is about 0.1 Mly across.

64. (a) Use the distance and velocity data in Figure 3.59 to find the rate of expansion as a function of distance. (b) If you extrapolate back in time, how long ago would all of the galaxies have been at approximately the same position? The two parts of this problem give you some idea of how the Hubble constant for universal expansion and the time back to the Big Bang are determined, respectively.

65. An athlete crosses a $2 5 - m$ -wide river by swimming perpendicular to the water current at a speed of $0 . 5 \mathsf { m } / \mathsf { s }$ relative to the water. They reach the opposite side at a distance $4 0 ~ \mathsf { m }$ downstream from the starting point. How fast is the water in the river flowing with respect to the ground? What is the speed of the swimmer with respect to a friend at rest on the ground?

66. A ship sailing in the Gulf Stream is heading $2 5 . 0 ^ { \circ }$ west of north at a speed of $4 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m / s }$ relative to the water. Its velocity relative to the Earth is $4 . 8 0 \mathrm { m / s }$ $5 . 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ west of north. What is the velocity of the Gulf Stream? (The velocity obtained is typical for the Gulf Stream a few hundred kilometers off the east coast of the United States.)

67. An ice hockey player is moving at $8 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m } / \mathsf { s }$ when they hit the puck toward the goal. The speed of the puck relative to the player is $2 9 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m } / \mathsf { s }$ . The line between the center of the goal and the player makes a $9 0 . 0 ^ { \mathrm { o } }$ angle relative to their path as shown in Figure $3 . 6 0$ . What angle must the puck’s velocity make relative to the player (in their frame of reference) to hit the center of the goal?

68. Unreasonable Results Suppose you wish to shoot supplies straight up to astronauts in an orbit $3 6 , 0 0 0 \mathrm { k m }$ above the surface of the Earth. (a) At what velocity must the supplies be launched? (b) What is unreasonable about this velocity? (c) Is there a problem with the relative velocity between the supplies and the astronauts when the supplies reach their maximum height? (d) Is the premise unreasonable or is the available equation inapplicable? Explain your answer.

69. Unreasonable Results A commercial airplane has an air speed of $2 8 0 \mathrm { m / s }$ due east and flies with a strong tailwind. It travels $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathsf { k m }$ in a direction $5 ^ { \mathrm { { o } } }$ south of east in $1 . 5 0 \mathrm { h }$ . (a) What was the velocity of the plane relative to the ground? (b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the tailwind’s velocity. (c) What is unreasonable about both of these velocities? (d) Which premise is unreasonable?

70. Construct Your Own Problem Consider an airplane headed for a runway in a cross wind. Construct a problem in which you calculate the angle the airplane must fly relative to the air mass in order to have a velocity parallel to the runway. Among the things to consider are the direction of the runway, the wind speed and direction (its velocity) and the speed of the plane relative to the air mass. Also calculate the speed of the airplane relative to the ground. Discuss any last minute maneuvers the pilot might have to perform in order for the plane to land with its wheels pointing straight down the runway.

71. Critical Thinking Two identical spring-loaded launchers are fixed to the end of a table. Launcher A is inclined $4 0 ^ { \circ }$ above the horizontal and launcher B is inclined $5 0 ^ { \circ }$ above the horizontal. (a) Which of these launchers will fire the ball the greatest vertical height above the launcher before it crashes into the ground? (b) Based on experimental data, an equation that fits the data is suggested for the vertical height above the launcher, y, which may not be correct: $y = K V _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \sin \theta$ , where $\boldsymbol { \kappa }$ is a constant with appropriate units, $V _ { 0 }$ is the initial velocity of the launcher, and $\theta$ is the angle relative to the $x \cdot$ -axis of the launcher. Is this equation consistent with your answer from part a? Explain why or why not. Does this equation make sense? Explain why or why not. (c) Graph the magnitude of the velocity vs. vertical height for both launcher A and B.
