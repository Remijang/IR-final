Part of the energy that they deposit by collision with an atom results in one or more of the atom\u2019s inner electrons being knocked into a higher orbit or the atom being ionized.

The most energetic of these are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled\u2014that is, when an $n = 1$ or $n = 2$ shell electron has been excited to a higher level, and another electron falls into the vacant spot. A characteristicxray(see Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum) is electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by an atom when an inner-shell vacancy is filled. Figure 30.21 shows a representative energy-level diagram that illustrates the labeling of characteristic x rays. X rays created when an electron falls into an $n = 1$ shell vacancy are called $K _ { \\alpha }$ when they come from the next higher level; that is, an $n = 2$ to $n = 1$ transition.

This is similar to what happens inside a charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so that it produces no electric field inside.

X rays are passed through a narrow section (called a slice) of the patient\u2019s body (or body part) over a range of directions.

        "text": "experiments were convincing, and the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to von Laue for his suggestion leading to the proof that x rays are EM waves. In 1915, the unique father-and-son team of Sir William Henry Bragg and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg were awarded a joint Nobel Prize for inventing the x-ray spectrometer and the thennew science of x-ray analysis. The elder Bragg had migrated to Australia from England just after graduating in mathematics. He learned physics and chemistry during his career at the University of Adelaide. The younger Bragg was born in Adelaide but went back to the Cavendish Laboratories in England to a career in x-ray and neutron crystallography; he provided support for Watson, Crick, and Wilkins for their work on unraveling the mysteries of DNA and to Max Perutz for his 1962 Nobel Prize-winning work on the structure of hemoglobin. Here again, we witness the enabling nature of physics\u2014establishing instruments and designing experiments as well as solving mysteries in the biomedical sciences. ",

        "text": "Certain other uses for x rays will be studied in later chapters. X rays are useful in the treatment of cancer because of the inhibiting effect they have on cell reproduction. X rays observed coming from outer space are useful in determining the nature of their sources, such as neutron stars and possibly black holes. Created in nuclear bomb explosions, x rays can also be used to detect clandestine atmospheric tests of these weapons. X rays can cause excitations of atoms, which then fluoresce (emitting characteristic EM radiation), making x-ray-induced fluorescence a valuable analytical tool in a range of fields from art to archaeology.
