Within a shell, the subshells fill starting with the lowest $l$ , or with the $s$ subshell, then the $p$ , and so on, usually until all subshells are filled. The first exception to this occurs for potassium, where the $4 s$ subshell begins to fill before any electrons go into the $3 d$ subshell. The next exception is not shown in Table 30.3; it occurs for rubidium, where the subshell starts to fill before the $4 d$ subshell.

Each group in the periodic table is characterized by its outermost electron configuration. Perhaps the most familiar is Group 18 (Group VIII), the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, etc.). These gases are all characterized by a filled outer subshell that is particularly stable. This means that they have large ionization energies and do not readily give up an electron. Furthermore, if they were to accept an extra electron, it would be in a significantly higher level and thus loosely bound. Chemical reactions often involve sharing electrons.

The halogens are also likely to form singly negative ions, such as $C 1 ^ { - }$ , fitting an extra electron into the vacancy in the outer subshell. In contrast, alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, all have a single electron in their outermost subshell (an $s ^ { 1 }$ configuration) and are members of Group 1 (Group I). These elements easily give up their extra electron and are thus highly reactive chemically.
