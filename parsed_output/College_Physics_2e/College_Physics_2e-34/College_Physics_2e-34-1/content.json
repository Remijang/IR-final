In the 1920s, Hubble first demonstrated conclusively that other galaxies, many previously called nebulae or clouds of stars, were outside our own. He then found that all but the closest galaxies have a red shift in their hydrogen spectra that is proportional to their distance. The explanation is that there is a cosmological red shift due to the expansion of space itself. The photon wavelength is stretched in transit from the source to the observer. Double the distance, and the red shift is doubled. While this cosmological red shift is often called a Doppler shift, it is not\u2014space itself is expanding. There is no center of expansion in the universe. All observers see themselves as stationary; the other objects in space appear to be moving away from them.

This small asymmetry produced slightly more matter than antimatter in the early universe.

The average particle energy would be this great at $1 0 ^ { - 3 4 }$ after the Big Bang, if there are no surprises in the unknown physics at energies above about 1 TeV. At the immense energy of $1 0 ^ { 1 4 }$ (corresponding to a temperature of about $1 0 ^ { 2 6 } ~ \\mathrm { { K } ) }$ , the $W ^ { \\pm }$ and $Z ^ { 0 }$ carrier particles would be transformed into massless gauge bosons to accomplish the unification. Before $1 0 ^ { - 3 4 }$ back to about $1 0 ^ { - 4 3 }$ , we have Grand Unification in the GUT epoch, in which all forces except gravity are identical. At $1 0 ^ { - 4 3 }$ , the average energy reaches the immense $1 0 ^ { 1 9 }$ needed to unify gravity with the other forces in TOE, the Theory of Everything. Before that time is the TOE epoch, but we have almost no idea as to the nature of the universe then, since we have no workable theory of quantum gravity. We call the hypothetical unified force superforce. ",

        "text": "Now let us imagine starting at TOE and moving forward in time to see what type of universe is created from various events along the way. As temperatures and average energies decrease with expansion, the universe reaches the stage where average particle separations are large enough to see differences between the strong and electroweak forces (at about $1 0 ^ { - 3 5 }$ ). After this time, the forces become distinct in almost all interactions\u2014they are no longer unified or symmetric. This transition from GUT to electroweak is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, in which conditions spontaneously evolved to a point where the forces were no longer unified, breaking that symmetry. This is analogous to a phase transition in the universe, and a clever proposal by American physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980s ties it to the smoothness of the CMBR. Guth proposed that spontaneous symmetry breaking (like a phase transition during cooling of normal matter) released an immense amount of energy that caused the universe to expand extremely rapidly for the brief time from $1 0 ^ { - 3 5 }$ to about $1 0 ^ { - 3 2 }$ . This expansion may have been by an incredible factor of $1 0 ^ { 5 0 }$ or more in the size of the universe and is thus called the inflationary scenario. One result of this inflation is that it would stretch the wrinkles in the universe nearly flat, leaving an extremely smooth CMBR. While speculative, there is as yet no other plausible explanation for the smoothness of the CMBR. Unless the CMBR is not really cosmic but local in origin, the distances between regions of similar temperatures are too great for any coordination to have caused them, since any coordination mechanism must travel at the speed of light. Again, particle physics and cosmology are intimately entwined. There is little hope that we may be able to test the inflationary scenario directly, since it occurs at energies near $1 0 ^ { 1 4 }$ , vastly greater than the limits of modern accelerators. But the idea is so attractive that it is incorporated into most cosmological theories. ",

The forces have not changed in time, but the average energy and separation of particles in the universe have. As discussed in The Four Basic Forces, the four basic forces in nature are distinct under most circumstances found today. The early universe and its remnants provide evidence from times when they were unified under most circumstances. ",
