Presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short.

In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. In the absence of light, the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones. Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the eye as the optic nerve). Thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence of activity, to encode visual signals for the brain. Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition. This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker. Amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells. ",

In what way does the overall magnitude of a stimulus affect the just-noticeable difference in the perception of that stimulus?   \n26. Describe the difference in the localization of the sensory receptors for general and special senses in humans.   \n27. What can be inferred about the relative sizes of the areas of cortex that process signals from skin not densely innervated with sensory receptors and skin that is densely innervated with sensory receptors?   \n28. Many studies have demonstrated that women are able to tolerate the same painful stimuli for longer than men. Why don\u2019t all people experience pain the same way?   \n29. From the perspective of the recipient of the signal, in what ways do pheromones differ from other odorants?   \n30. What might be the effect on an animal of not being able to perceive taste?   \n31. A few recent cancer detection studies have used trained dogs to detect lung cancer in urine samples. What is the hypothesis behind this study? Why are dogs a better choice of detectors in this study than humans?   \n32. How would a rise in altitude likely affect the speed of a sound transmitted through air? Why?   \n33. How might being in a place with less gravity than Earth has (such as Earth\u2019s moon) affect vestibular sensation, and why?   \n34. How does the structure of the ear allow a person to determine where a sound originates?   \n35. How could the pineal gland, the brain structure that plays a role in annual cycles, use visual information from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus?   \n36. How is the relationship between photoreceptors and bipolar cells different from other sensory receptors and adjacent cells?   \n37. Cataracts, the medical condition where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, are a leading cause of blindness. Describe how developing a cataract would change the path of light through the eye. ",
