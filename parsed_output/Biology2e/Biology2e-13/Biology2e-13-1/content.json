With each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct X-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and migrated to separate cellular poles.

If the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes that are either ABor abwith a 1:1 ratio. If the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce AB, $A b$ , aB, and abgametes with equal frequencies, according to the Mendelian concept of independent assortment. Because they correspond to new allele combinations, the genotypes Ab and aB are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis. Parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. Morgan and his colleagues, however, found that when they test crossed such heterozygous individuals to a homozygous recessive parent $( A a B b \\times a a b b )$ , both parental and nonparental cases occurred. For example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were either $A a B b$ or a b , but 50 offspring would also result that were either Aab or a Bb.
