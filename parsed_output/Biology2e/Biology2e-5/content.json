Analogously, a plasma membrane\u2019s functions involve movement within the cell and across boundaries' activities. (credit: modification of work by Randy Le\u2019Moine) "

The plasma membrane is selectively permeable. This means that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell, while other materials cannot move freely, but require a specialized structure, and occasionally, even energy investment for crossing.
