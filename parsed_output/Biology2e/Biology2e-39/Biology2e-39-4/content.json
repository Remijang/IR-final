Several properties of carbon dioxide in the blood affect its transport. First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma. Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind to hemoglobin. This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed. Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. Therefore, when it reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body. ",

Carbonic anhydrase (CA) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid $\\mathrm { ( H } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { C O } _ { 3 } )$ . Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions $\\mathrm { ( H C O } _ { 3 } ^ { - }$ and hydrogen $\\mathrm { ( H ^ { + } ) }$ ions. Since carbon dioxide is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its concentration gradient. It also results in the production of $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions. If too much $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { H } } ^ { + }$ is produced, it can alter blood pH. However, hemoglobin binds to the free $\\mathrm { H } ^ { + }$ ions and thus limits shifts in $\\mathsf { p H }$ . The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl-); this is called the chloride shift. When the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion. The $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { H } } ^ { + }$ ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. This produces the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of CA.

It is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term exposure can cause brain damage or death.
