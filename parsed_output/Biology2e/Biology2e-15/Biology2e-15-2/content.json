A bacterial chromosome is a closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. The central region of the cell in which prokaryotic DNA resides is called the nucleoid region. In addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter, circular DNA molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. Plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as those involved with antibiotic resistance. ",

The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. Transcription always proceeds from the same DNA strand for each gene, which is called the template strand. The mRNA product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other DNA strand, called the nontemplate strand, or the coding strand. The only nucleotide difference is that in mRNA, all of the T nucleotides are replaced with U nucleotides (Figure 15.7). In an RNA double helix, A can bind U via two hydrogen bonds, just as in A\u2013T pairing in a DNA double helix. ",

These subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. Each subunit has a unique role; the two $\\alpha$ -subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the DNA; the $\\beta \\mathrm { . }$ -subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent mRNA molecule; and the $\\beta ^ { \\prime }$ subunit binds the DNA template strand. The fifth subunit, $\\sigma _ { . }$ , is involved only in transcription initiation.

In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. Although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are evolutionarily conserved in many species. At the -10 and $- 3 5$ regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoterconsensussequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species (Figure 15.8). The -10 sequence, called the -10 region, has the consensus sequence TATAAT. The $- 3 5$ sequence has the consensus sequence TTGACA. These consensus sequences are recognized and bound by $\\sigma$ . Once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. The A\u2013T-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the DNA template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. The transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released. ",

Depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. One is proteinbased and the other is RNA-based. Rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mRNA chain. Near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of G nucleotides on the DNA template and it stalls. As a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase.
