Lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modernday example of the connection between our health and the natural world (Figure 44.1). More formally known as Lyme borreliosis, Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (Ixodesscapularisin the eastern U.S., and Ixodespacificusalong the Pacific coast). Deer ticks are the primary vectors(a vector is an organism that transmits a pathogen) for this disease. However, not all ticks carry the pathogen, and not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause Lyme disease in humans. Also, the ticks I.scapularisand pacificuscan have other hosts besides deer. In fact, it turns out that the probabilityofinfectiondepends on the type of host upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer. Knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how Lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.
