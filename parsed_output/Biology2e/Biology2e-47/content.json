        "text": "INTRODUCTION In the 1980s, biologists working in Lake Victoria in Africa discovered one of the most extraordinary products of evolution on the planet. Located in the Great Rift Valley, Lake Victoria is an enormous and deep lake about $6 8 , 9 0 0 { \\mathrm { k m } } ^ { 2 }$ in area (larger than Lake Huron, the second largest of North America\u2019s Great Lakes). Biologists were studying species of a family of fish called cichlids. When they sampled for fish in different locations of the lake, the researchers identified over 500 evolved species in total. However, the scientists soon discovered that the invasive Nile Perch was destroying the lake\u2019s cichlid population, bringing hundreds of cichlid species to extinction with devastating rapidity.
