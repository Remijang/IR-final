The Asian carp in the photograph on the right were harvested from the Little Calumet River in Illinois in May, 2010, using rotenone, a toxin often used as an insecticide, in an effort to learn more about the population of the species.

This is now a risk on many rivers and canal systems in Illinois and Missouri because of the presence of Asian carp. ",
