Nearly 90 percent of all vascular plant species have mycorrhizal partners.

Hyphae grow from the mantle into the root and envelope the outer layers of the root cells in a network of hyphae called a Hartignet(Figure 24.21). The fungal partner can belong to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota or Zygomycota. Endomycorrhizae (\"inside\" mycorrhizae), also called arbuscularmycorhizae, are produced when the fungi grow inside the root in a branched structure called an arbuscule(from the Latin for \u201clittle trees\u201d). The fungal partners of endomycorrhizal associates all belong to the Glomeromycota. The fungal arbuscules penetrate root cells between the cell wall and the plasma membrane and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant (Figure 24.21b and Figure 24.22b). Orchids rely on a third type of mycorrhiza. Orchids are epiphytes that typically produce very small airborne seeds without much storage to sustain germination and growth. Their seeds will not germinate without a mycorrhizal partner (usually a Basidiomycete). After nutrients in the seed are depleted, fungal symbionts support the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and minerals. Some orchids continue to be mycorrhizal throughout their life cycle. ",
